1652,"I will start by saying I do not usually read these types of books. They're just not really my style or something I've ever been interested in. But I saw the trailer for the movie online and it looked interesting. When I found out it was based off a book, I decided to try it out given the great reviews.I really cannot say enough how much I enjoyed this book. I read it within 15 hours - 7 for sleeping and I also have a toddler at home so not a lot of time to myself. And that was after I had googled to see what happened (I know you're not supposed to, but I hate getting invested in a book only to have the ending piss me off). I still wanted to keep reading even though I knew how it ended. The writing in my opinion was fantastic - there are so many great lines from this book that I have saved. I am really looking forward to the movie coming out and to future books from this author.",book
4818,"An absolute marvel. Written perfectly and kept me guessing all the way through. The plot, twists, characters, settings, all perfect and unique and eerily believable. A definite read! Thank you Paula Hawkins.",book
886,"Truly, one of the worst books I've read in years. Though it tries to be suspenseful, it is simply chaotic � yet fashionably predictable. The writing leaves a lot to be desired. I'm sure the film will be different, but I simply cannot recommend this book. It took a lot of will to finish it.",book
2879,"I did not read any of the thousands of reviews for this book. I didn't want to be distracted by what anyone else thought and make up my own mind.I found the story  disappointing. I had been excited to read it as I used to commute on the train to London when I worked there and remember peering out at the houses/gardens when we stopped along the way...As an author too, I could imagine weaving an exciting, mysterious, fictional tale around people who lived near the track, but this wasn't exciting or mysterious. I'm really not sure why this is a best seller. I didn't get a good ""feel"" for the characters, found the story too loose, a little distasteful and not really believable.",book

Once I was able to get pass all the pussy footing around, the story did start to get exciting.  I really felt sorry for the main character, Rachel.  She was going thru a very rough time and loved to fantasize about a couple she saw daily.  As the story unfolds, you realize that Rachel really has problems and not just mental ones.  A good read if you don't mind the dragging out in the beginning.",book

2048,"Taut thriller. Not a wasted word! Like a play with an ensemble cast. Amazingly mesmerizing first person narration with stream-of-consciousness interior monologue, the writing itself is a metaphor for the suffocating neuroses each major character suffers from. Powerful psychodrama that makes you feel their suffering without asking you to forgive or like the characters, but helps you understand how anguish causes us to make bad decisions. This is more than a thriller, this is literature!",book
751,"Careful reading at first will help the reader get the five main characters in focus, and some patience is needed with Rachel.  However,  one is so rewarded by the exciting plot as it unfolds, taking the reader through twist after psychological twist.  I enjoyed the luxury of POV renderings of each character, and the clever way the author left clues for me to think about as the end rushed toward me like a Runaway Train trying to reach its station before the good are not saved and the bad are not caught..  The author makes you care so much for each character, regardless of their weaknesses. Will their strengths of character emerge to bring this complicated human puzzle to a satisfying end? Or will the reader be left asking more questions and be enticed to want more about the future of these characters and those their lives touched?  What an intriguing ride!",book

2339,"This a nuanced mystery that unfolds gradually as the reader experiences three alternating points of view. Each narrator is unreliable for different reasons and the lines between truth/lies and reality/fantasy are ever-shifting.

This tale is a chilling reminder that there are many types of abuse, and we never really know what happens behind closed doors�even, at times, our own.",book
3963,Well written and deeply engrossing. Perhaps the best passages are those in which the despair and embarrassment of  Rachel's addiction are so acutely felt. Hard to imagine the author hasn't been there herself.,book
1522,"Overall I enjoyed this read. It was quick and held my interest. However, I don't know if I would rate it as high as everyone who told me about the book rated it. Maybe there was too much hype around the story for me and being let down was inevitable. I didn't get invested in the characters and never had a doubt that it would all work out well in the end. I'm glad I read this story and would recommend it as a beach read. But it is not the type of book which will stick in my mind long after reading. In fact, I found it somewhat forgettable.",book
2058,"Great read!! I rarely give 5 Stars but this book totally deserves it.I loved the plot; a very sad, lonely, drunk, yet sympathetic woman cannot seem to let her ex husband go and move on with her life. She certainly has reason to be angry with him, he dumped her for another woman, but 2 years later she is still obsessed to the point of losing everyone and everything in her life. At times you really feel for her but other times you just want to shake her and tell her to get over it.One drunken night, while she (Rachel), acts on an impulse and decides to show up at her ex husband's house, she finds herself in the middle out of a missing persons investigation.The story is told alternately between the points of view of Rachel, Anna (former mistress, current wife of Rachel's ex) and Megan (missing women).  As the plot unfolds, we find out more about each woman, their lives, histories and motives. We also realize how little people really know about others and how outside impressions can be very deceiving.While reading this book, I didn't really find myself reflecting on the writing style. To me, that means it was written seamlessly for the story. The book was easy to get hooked on, I couldn't put it down once I got started. The ending was not what I had expected. Although  the 'bad guy' was one of several on my list, I really didn't figure it out until very near the end.I highly recommend reading this book. I'd love to hear others thoughts on it. It would make a great book club read.",book
3527,"This page turner reminds me of English mystery writers of my mothers generation. Well written, well thought out, and cleverly presented.

4139,"This novel captivated me from the beginning. Maybe it was how normally flawed the main character was? How realistically she was portrayed? How easy it was to believe she was real? This novel wasn't deep or life changing, but it was very readable and entertaining. For me, I'd describe it not as the main course, or even the vegetable or potatoes. No, it is more like the popcorn in the movie theater, that has just enough butter and salt to make you take long drags on your soda and lick your fingers from time to time.",book
2343,"I started this book only because friends told me it was good.  At first, I didn't believe what they were telling me but I kept reading. This book is so well written that after a short time I could not have stopped.  The mystery is woven into twisted that kept me reading. I needed to know what happens to Megan, and Rachel.  It has 5 stars from me plus if you haven't read it, I suggest you do.",book

3758,This was a really excellent book. I could barely put it down. The author did an excellent job of writing the characters' feelings and thoughts in a way where I easily identified with them and was able to feel their perspective like it was my own. Definitely a must read.,book
3152,I enjoyed this book quite a bit. The premise of the story was made so much better by the lead character having alcohol induced black outs. I've definitely had a black out or two and the inability to remember things is brutal. I ended up reading this in three sittings. I'm hoping the upcoming movie will do it justice.,book
4988,"I have seen this compared to Gone Girl, but personally I liked Girl on the Train much more.  I can usually guess an ending, but Paula Hawkins completely fooled me.  I really like her twisty narrative style.  When I reached the end, I went back to the beginning to understand how she had fooled me.  I laughed out loud in admiration.  Can't wait for her next book.",book
3710,"It's obvious why this book has been #1 on the Best Seller list for some time.  It's a fast page turning old fashioned mystery that doesn't divulge the murderer until the end.

1146,"*No Spoilers*This book is a lot of fun. Lots of page turning, plenty of twists and a classic unreliable narrator. Good stuff.Rachel is an alcoholic and has lost her job. She rides the train all day to keep her roommate from knowing that she�s now unemployed. Her train happens to pass by the house she once owned with her husband, Tom. Tom is now married to Anna and they live happily in what was once her home. Rachel�s train ride through London is often spent tipping a bottle back. Seeing her old home and sometimes even catching a glimpse of the other woman, is enough to make her drink and drink she does. So much so, that what she sees is often not remembered later.That memory thing becomes a problem early on.Yes. It. Does.Rachel�s daily observances include a couple that she�s come to know as Jess and Jason, names she�s made up to give them substance. She watches them interacting on the balcony of their apartment, and she�s dreamed up a back story for them. But when Jess does something out of character for her, and then a crime is committed, Rachel takes it upon herself to investigate.As you can imagine, things get out of hand. Rachel sticks her nose into their lives and in the process, ends up involving her ex-husband and his wife. Both, really want nothing to do with Rachel but out of obligation, aware of Rachel�s raging alcoholism, Tom tries to look out for her when he can, which infuriates Anna.Tension mounts as the story unfolds and when you get to those last few chapters, you can�t help but turn the kids away, let your dinner burn, etc. The ending needs to be read uninterrupted. Don�t tell me that I didn�t warn you.But, honestly, Rachel�s antics were a little tiring. Just when I started to grow bored with her, some critical piece of info would surface and then I�d be flipping pages again. I suppose that�s a sign of true suspense because there was no way I was going to put the book down. I knew that from the start. Does it deserve the hype? Yes, I think so. If you pick it up for pure fun, you will enjoy it quite a bit. If you pick it apart and compare it to other books, you might find fault with some of it but really, who has the time for that?Read it, because it�s fun and it�s a great distraction from all the crap going on in the world today.",book
2699,"I literally hated the other book...the one this gets compared to so often. But the only thing I hated about these characters is how obsessed they were with being thin or fat, smooth or splotchy, sexy or dull. The story was very good. I doubted all of them, but not as much the one who did it all.",book
2322,"I absolutely loved this book.  It was a real page turner!  I had all sorts of emotions from both liking and hating Rachel, then feeling sorry for her and back to hating her again for her weakness.  At the end I was totally relating to her and pulling for her to have a good future.  In fact, I still think of her almost as if she was a real person that I know and I find myself hoping that she is happy and doing well.  Now, I call that a good book.Barbara Miller Whitton",book

1607,"How can you like or care about any of the 4 key characters?! They are so self absorbed. Rachel is a train wreck and reading this book is equivalent to not being able to turn away from looking at a horrible wreck and when it is out of sight, a range of feelings may remain with you but would you recommend the scene to others? I can't. Perhaps creating a sense of voyeurism was the author's intent and the editor's goal and they succeeded.  However the pace is too slow and it isn't a surprise ending for an ex-wife and a wife to align against an evil husband.",book
4388,"This story immediately brought me back to my commuting days, boring house spent wondering about the people who lived along the train tracks. Hawkins takes that universal experience and spins it into a suspenseful tale that keeps the reader wondering and turning pages. It's a frighteningly apt portrait of life under the influence of alcohol, with jobs and relationships and facts slipping through the main character's fingers. I could not put this book down. Swift and crafty and insightful, it's a fine suspense novel. Small moments make big scary stories.",book
543,"The plot, such as it was, was rife with holes and inconsistencies. There wasn't a single likable or reliable to be found. The women were all victims-of themselves, of men, of each other. The men were all abusive and two out if three were openly misogynist. I was astonished to find the author was a woman - as the woman-hating tone started early and ran so deep. I suppose you could write it off to artistic license if the book were otherwise engaging, entertaining or thought-provoking - but it's not.",book

424,"This books is pretty good-- not amazing. Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read. Not a must-read by any means, but I enjoyed the book.",book
2859,"Wow, everyone was so flawed in this story but that was their saving grace. I didn't like a single character, not even Eivy. Yet I cared for every single one of them. I was connected to them by every facet of their lives.Excellent writing. A story worthy of a second read.",book
662,"I was sooo excited to read this book after all of the great things I heard about it.  It took me a couple of tries before I was in the right frame of mind to read it.  For me, there was too much of the book wrapped up in how drunk and miserable she was.  This part got old fast and made the story drag on.  I guessed who the villain was way before the end of the book.  I think I would have liked it more if the main character, Rachel, would have made more attempts to improve herself throughout the story, even as she was embroiled in her obsession.  Her pathetic nature just kind of overshadowed the whole book for me.",book
919,"This book is a very good read.  I have been at the book store and near the shelves that house this book and heard a person giving their opinion of the book to others and they could not have been more wrong. Then turning to me and saying ""Don't waste your time it is not a good book.""  Not to give any spoilers but what they were commenting about was the writing and how it was a little ""All over"".  It is supposed to be written like that, from the point view of the main character who has some issues and needs to figure out what is real or not.  I really enjoyed this book and know several others who have too.",book

147,"I love a good mystery. I really can't remember one like this of all the hundreds I've read that used alcohol and alcoholism in this way. I thought the merger of this and also the conflicting  relationships secrets people hide and also find out about people they never suspected was very intriguing. I did guess correctly but did have my doubts and second guessed myself due to the creative writing and the excellent drama created. I would highly recommend this book. I also listened to a portion of it and loved the main character's narrator. The other one was good for that person, as well. But I am so glad she wasn't the main reader and was that way for a reason because when people talk like that for a whole story I just start to feel extremely awful. As in bored and anxiously so.The subject of domestic abusive was dealt with relatively well. Some really enlightening segments, which is always good.",book
1543,"The book starts out a bit slow in the beginning and becomes a little tiresome switching between three different points of view of three different characters. Each character has a similar depressed viewpoint and the repetition begins to wear down on the desire to continue to read the book. The ""twist"" will most likely become obvious to most readers earlier than author may have intended which will make getting through to the end a chore. Despite the comparison by others, this book is nowhere near as good as Gone Girl.",book
1037,"All three narrators of the book are unlikeable. It's very depressing and the beginning is quite slow, but overall it's a decent read. Many people describe the ending as a twist but I would disagree as I found it somewhat predictable. The ending was also underdone in my opinion.",book

908,"""The Girl on the Train"" is a voyeuristic, cleverly plotted thrill ride.  Paula Hawkins is a first-time novelist.  She's a writer and editor by profession though, so 'Train' is no flying blind leap into a new career.  The writing and plotting here is ingenious and first rate.Were someone to tell you about the literary device employed here --- three first-person voices, alternating by paragraph, over different time periods -- you might think, jeez, that sounds hard to follow.  It's not. You pick up on it right away and get immediately into the flow.You can almost see the cinema version of the book in your mind's eye as you blitz through it.  So, no surprise then to read that Dreamworks preemptively acquired the rights to Hawkins' work late last year.",book
4394,"The book did not grab me in the beginning. In fact, I almost put it down to read a different book. But since i started it i decided to continue to see if it would pick up. It did.

814,"Interesting, compelling storyline and definitely held my attention to the end.  The characters and their flaws just kept coming but not in a way that detracted but instead pulled you into the story tighter and tighter.  I must admit to feeling exhausted by the time it ended.I can certainly understand why this book was chosen to become a movie.",book
788,"This is a book review, not a summary, so I won't simply regurgitate the story here.I hadn't heard the comparisons between Girl on the Train and Gone Girl before I read this novel but I can see some resemblance: both have female leads and both have great plot twists. Other than that, they're completely different. I liked the perspective of seeing things from inside a train and how that narrow focus gradually widened until we could see the whole picture. There were a few obvious red herrings but the suspense was maintained throughout. Also, I think the author nailed the behavior of an alcoholic as well as how such behavior has a ripple effect on everyone else. However, the overall character development -- so important for a good story -- was a little thin (I never got a solid mental picture of anyone), but the pacing was fantastic and the plot twists were well done so that's why I gave it four stars.",book
3943,"Paula Hawkins scores a huge literary and commercial success. Loved this very cleverly written whodunit..... did not want it to end. Kept me guessing almost to the end. Hoping a movie will be made, but not sure how they could possibly capture the mood and use the various narrators to tell the story as the book does. Highly recommended.",book
2289,"This strange and ultimately not quite satisfying novel begins oddly enough with divorced Rachael Watson traveling past her ex-husband's and his new wife's condo located next to the tracks of her commuter train near London. Due to a malfunctioning railway signal the train frequently comes to a complete halt giving her a good view.  But of most interest to her is an unknown couple she names Jess and Jason who live a few doors up and, based on her fragmentary spying, seem to be immensely happy. Or so she idealizes.Rachael's interest is piqued when she observes some disturbing behavior at Jess's home but turns to alarm when Jess' disappearance becomes a major story in the newspapers. She insinuates herself into the situation in various ways but she can't recall everything she sees and does. The problem: she binge drinks and has blackouts. The story is told from the perspectives of Rachael, Jess, and Anna, her ex's new wife both from the past and in the present.The problem with this story is that all of the back and forth becomes a substitute for complexity. The essence of the story is the rapid uncovering of the unsophisticated lies of a small group of rather unappealing characters. The book really does not quite reach its initial promise.",book

So got through it in a day and a half.  Nice way to spend a rainy weekend...Was it worth the Kindle price?  ($9.17 US) Yes.Did I learn something form this book? No.  With some books you walk away knowing that you have learned something about life or some aspect of life and in some ways, have grown from the experience.  But to be fair, while I did enjoy this book immensely, I am not a wiser/better person for it.SPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTSPOILER ALERTOk, if Megan never told anyone but her therapist about Libby (and he's not allowed to say) and Mac is dead, how did the media find out?",book
1609,"One of those overrated novels everyone reads. It is relentlessly dark. Every major character is morally empty: liars, cheaters, drunks. And, a killer. There's a surprise , of course. The plot twist is the reward for your slog through the novel, but you'll figure it out before the big reveal. So, even that seems hollow; formulaic.It's the kind of novel that makes you want to go to the liquor store, but not the nice one; the one in the sketchy neighborhood, by the railroad tracks. For cheap wine.",book
301,"I feel this book started slowly......a boring account of random details that jump back and forth. However, a little more than half way through I see the meaning of all those details as they start to merge together and tie my mind into a suspenseful clutch that kept me interested and unable to put the book down.Even after the ""big reveal"" towards the end there's still a lot of questions and suspense and the story draws to a conclusion. I do feel it ended rather weak.....missing that OMG feeling as I turned the last page. And still I have two remaining questions???(Possible SPOILER BELOW)1) What ever happened to Scott? Did he find out what really happened?2) Did Rachel and/or Anna tell the police about Tom & Megan??Did I miss something?",book

She gets involved in making up stories about a couple who live on the train route as she longs for her ex-husband who lives on the same street.

493,"This thriller sucked me in. I loved how slowly the author unraveled the layers for the reader but still left enough questions to keep the reader doubting and questioning their own conclusions. I also applaud her strong multifaceted characterizations of all the female characters. They are all flawed but also real and they lack any shallow pretense. There is a melancholy intensity to all of them without being trite amd I appreciated them and the writing and story more for it.Writing from different character perspectives is difficult to achieve successfully but Hawkins does a great job of it.Highly recommend this book if you enjoy the combination of sharp, smart writing and thrillers.",book

1416,"Though 2 stars is a low rating this book isn't terrible by any means, it's just nothing exceptional. The writing was good, I can't fault Paula Hawkins on that. The problem is the disdainful characters. My contempt for them stems not from their acts but rather their lack of any redeeming, interesting, qualities. I can be enthralled by characters like Dorian Grey or Frank Underwood regardless of their unsightly actions because their personalities stand out. In The Girl on the Train each character is only a collection of actions and plot related concerns that changes like ""clouds scudding across the sky, now dark, now light.""",book

This book reminded me of the writings of one of my favorite authors Ruth Rendell.  If you are a fan of English authors, whether it be mystery, suspense or just good story you will like this book.  The similarity I found between the writings of these two authors is not the reason I liked it so much it was just an added bonus.  I hope that Paula Hawkins writes another one soon to see if I am right. And, if so, she establishes her own followers of readers that say she is a favorite.",book
782,"I read this after it was recommended by a friend. I thought it was fast paced & interesting. I'm not a big fan of ""amnesia"" murder stories because it's all too convenient. It's also frustrating! The chapters are written in different point of views. Not only do you have to pay attention to which character is narrating the chapter, but what the date is for that chapter, too. I also found it sad that I didn't like any of the characters. Every time I thought that maybe a character was okay, something would occur that would change my mind. All of the main characters had some kind of mental health issue.

The whole book goes back and forth between what happened, I'm scared, she acts completely paranoid, and round and round we go. I just wanted the book to get on with it!!  Seriously how many times can we stand to listen to her internal monologue?  Not to mention this book is extremely depressing. Author needs an editor.

2,"I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: ""I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember."" I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little. Oh, right, she's the woman who is responsible for the breakdown of Rachel's marriage and is now married to Rachel's ex, Tom.As others have noted, the three female characters have little to discern them from each other, and speak in a nearly identical voice - except one of them drinks. All three lament about men - constantly. They seem to have no other life interests - not one has a hobby, a job, or anything compelling her forward from day to day that doesn't have to do with a guy. (The guys all turn out to be jerks.)I suppose people like this do exist, I'm just not sure why I'm supposed to care about them - or why anyone else did, or how this book got to be so popular. I've heard it was compared to Gone Girl but other than both having a missing woman at the core, and 'Girl' in the title, there seems to be no comparison whatsoever.The 'twist' isn't a twist in the slightest, just the reveal of the missing woman's murderer, and it's exactly who, about three-fourths of the way through (and I'm not good at guessing twists), you suspect it is.  Then the 'reveal' is the guy confessing he did it in a speech you'd hear some cartoonish villain give in a super hero movie or soap opera. That kind of 'Bwahahaha I did it!' thing. Very convenient.But I guess the biggest thing that bothered me was that the entire crux of the story is based on the idea that Rachel has an alcoholic blackout - and the author explains (twice) that when you are having an alcoholic blackout, your brain does not create memories - so there is nothing to 'remember'- but then lo and behold she suddenly has a memory breakthrough, and solves the crime. I thought she wouldn't have been creating memories? It's as if the author wrote half her book, then decided to do some research (googling) and when she found research that blatantly contradicted the plot point her book hinges on, decided ""Oh, what the heck, I'll keep writing"" and then decided to INCLUDE her research. And her editor didn't notice or (more likely) didn't care.A couple of other things an editor (if this book had one) should have picked up on: Much is made of a pile of clothes by the train tracks - so much so that the book opens with a description of them - the importance of the clothes? None. Zip. Zero. And there's a red haired man who keeps popping up - muttering esoteric things - we assume he will be integral to the mystery. Nope, he just disappears.Other stuff I could complain about but it would be spoilery. It seems if books are bought by book clubs, they become huge sellers, no matter how evisceratingly terrible (witness 50 Shades of Grey).Here's one thing I admire the author for: She wrote this book in four months (it shows) and it became a HUGE bestseller. Awesome for her. So few authors ever make it to that level - even with stunningly well-written books - so kudos to her for whatever alchemy happened to guarantee she's got some money to retire on.",book
318,"I know that I'm one out of thousands who wrote a review for this book but I just couldn't help myself in relating my viewpoint.  I bought the book from amazon because every article raved about the book, calling it the new ""Gone Girl"", which I also read.  The story revolves around three women; the girl on the train, Rachel, who really should be the ""woman"" on the train because she is no longer a girl, being in her thirties.  Meagan and Anna are the other two women in the story.  Rachel, who is out of work and an alcoholic, gets on the train every day to go to a job that she no longer has and returns at the end of the day to where she shares a flat with another woman.  She is also an ex-wife of a man who has remained in their home, with his new wife, the one who caused the divorce, and their baby.  The new wife is Anna and Meagan is their neighbor.  These people all live in homes bordering the train tracks and so Rachel, on her travels to her non-job, passes by and watches them in their daily lives, still pining away for her ex-husband and builds an imaginary life for Meagan who lives with her husband a few doors down.  As each woman speaks in the novel, you get an insight into what really is going on in her life.  The problem with the story is that Rachel, Anna, and Meagan all appear to have the same personality which confused me and I found myself going back several pages to see which woman was talking.  Since they each had different problems and lives it would make sense that they had varied personalities and would not sound like Rachel.  And even though Rachel didn't want her flat-mate to find out that she lost her job, I couldn't relate to the fact that she was spending every day traveling into London and back again, just to spy on her ex-husband, etc.  Many times I wanted to put the book down and forget it but once I pay for something, I force myself to read on, hoping it will improve, thus the ending, which I found a little more to my liking.  I can't say that this is the ""new"" ""Gone Girl"", because the story is different and I couldn't really get hold of the characters as well as I should.  It's the kind of novel that you take to the beach if you're near one, or read in the backyard for an afternoon.  For a first published novel, I think the author tried to put the story into perspective as she saw it, but I felt I had to push myself to finish the book.  Happily I did so that I could enjoy the ending.",book

In retrospect, there were many misdirections and red herrings littering the tale. Story lines never fully developed and introduced characters left dangling. The different narratives from the women was at first interesting, but later grew tedious, as they kept doing, saying, thinking the same things.The male characters were almost indistinguishable except for the exotic doctor. Another red herring. Like the red-haired guy on the train.SPOILER ALERT! Do not read on if you've not read the book:There are 5 main characters and one of them was the murderer. No shock there. What's shocking about that? I mean, shocking would have been that all three women turned out to be the same person? With the way the dates jumped around, it could have been possible. Or perhaps Megan never died--It was not her body. She was just starting life over somewhere else? Or perhaps the baby, Evie, would be the killer? THAT would've been shocking! But not the dull ending, where a drunk lady starts to remember stuff. Ho hum. Tremendously long-winded build-up to a klutzy, quick finish.Not worth the hype.",book

This is indeed a ""Hitchcockian"" thriller that slowly unwinds and leads to an ending that wraps things up but is a bit unsatisfying...maybe because after all the build up I expected more.  Still, this is one of the more engaging books I've read in awhile and it was hard to put down once I got going.  Alcoholic train commuter Rachel likes to watch out the window going to/from the city and enjoys making up a life for a couple she frequently sees outdoors on their terrace.

It was a very decent read, but I can't help feel it could have been so much more with the premise and start of the story being as thought out as it was.  The story revolves around a divorcee who binge drinks and her inability to be a 'reliable' witness in a missing persons case. This could have gone many ways, but ended up with all the males in the story being  users of the women they were with in many different incarnations. This was more the crux of the story; rather than being a mystery (which it still was) it was also a statement on the abusive side of relationships. I would go 3 1/2 stars, but you can't do halves.  It's better than average and and entertaining to read, but still have that gnaw in my gut that it could have been plotted into something much more.

But I found myself getting ahead of the writer with my own assumptions and a couple of characters are left scratching their heads and squinting their eyes wondering when there turn will come or that's how I see them.I wanted to be surprised in the end and I wasn't. I was even a little disappointed, but that could be my own vivid imagination getting in the way. I may even go back and read the last few chapters to see what I may have missed.4 stars for The Girl on the Train. I really did like it.

The characters are all pretty much dusturbing, and building them up was a long start, but then you get invested in guessing who could be the killer.",book
2848,This book took a long time to really get to suspenseful and I would not consider it a thriller on any level. Most of the time is spent waiting for the main character to try to remember what happened on one of the many black out drunk episodes she experiences throughout most of the book.,book
966,"This one kept me turning the pages.  It presents you with a cast of characters who's lives have touched.  They are all woven together by the relentless imagination of one alcoholic and tragically lonely women, Rachel.  While you know that she has an active imagination you go right along with her as she attempts to make sense out of her rudderless life.  She manages to drag her ex-husband and his family into her drama and a couple that lives a few doors down as well.  Every day brings just a little more information to the light.  But what is true and what has her mind made up?  It is a page turner and when one of the characters goes missing it keeps you up at night trying to reach the conclusion.  A good one.  Well worth it.",book
3453,I will not recommend it to friends. The payoff was vastly insufficient to justify the time I spent getting to the end.,book
2749,"This book was o.k. Neither fantastic nor horrible, just somewhere in the middle. It's definitely not as good as Gone Girl. I figured out who did it about half way through so the rest of the book felt like it was dragging a little. I wouldnt say this book wasn't worth the time it took read it but don't go into it expecting it to top Gone Girl because it won't. If you have a few days with some time on your hands, give it a try.",book
1406,"What's the fuss?  I was looking forward to reading before the movie came out.  I read it and it was the same thing over and over again.  No plot twists, just blackouts and alcoholism wrapped up in murder.  Nothing special.  No interest in seeing the movie.  This book was not a page turner nor was it something I looked forward to reading.  I kept reading waiting for something, but by the end, I was glad it was over.",book
4976,"A pretty good novel that forces you into the lives of several people, with a murder that brings the whole plot into focus.  Some may find the style a bit irritating as the chapters flip from one person to the next.  Each personality is similar enough that I sometimes had to look back to see which one was engaged.  I enjoyed the book and recommend it.",book
2405,"Although I found this story quite predictable, I did appreciate the twists & turns that it took. This book reads a lot like Gone Girl, with a similar format and intertwined story line; however, I found it less complex and not quite as exciting. This book was a very quick read - only took me a day! - so it's great to bring along for a beach day in the Summer or a longer flight. I would re-read the story again, just wasn't as impressed as I thought I would be.",book
3502,"This book was really good.  Although it took me quite a while until I got into it, when it finally came together to me (perhaps I'm a little slow?).  I had a hard time realizing that this was the same girl...I thought it was two different people and was confused for a while.  Anyway,  as the story unfolds, it became clearer who everyone was.  The ending was a surprise and it's always nice to be surprised at the end.  Good book.",book

1564,"Disappointing. It felt like the author was trying too hard to be suspenseful and thrilling. It shouldn't be compared to ""Gone Girl"" because readers would expect a lot. If you're a love of suspenseful mystery thrillers, this is NOT recommended. I figured out the entire plot line once one of the characters narration came in.",book
784,"I can't believe how popular this book is! None of the main characters are likeable or nuanced. The female characters all share the same character flaw which guides their poor choices. Bunch of doormats willing to put up with significant weaknesses in their interpersonal relationships who keep repeating the same self destructive behaviors.  The male characters are self-centered and misogynistic.  Yuck.  The storyline is billed as mystery, but it's not a very iintriguing plot. The ending is not realistic and not satisfying, I guess in large part because by then I disliked the main protagonist so much I just didn't care about her ""happy ending.""",book

A friend encouraged me to stick with it, so I started to read it again. I didn't want to put it down; there were so many twists and turns. It was a little hard to get into, but once you did it was a very good ! I would definitely recommend it to people who like  mysteries.",book
4653,"Paula Hawkins grabs your attention right from the start and she has you wondering why you might be interested in  a self-admitted drunk on a train.

2504,"I hated this book.  Could not wait to for it to end.  Why did I not  just toss it when I realized I did not like it?  Well that's just me, once I start something I have to finish it.  Anyhow, I just couldn't stand any of the characters.  Without a connection to anyone, it was worse than one of my boring college textbooks.",book
227,Interesting but one of those books where you want to choke the main character.,book
1735,Not my style.  Didn't like it and I didn't finish it.  I got very tired of reading about how drunk she was over and over and over.  I think the book could have been half it's size if the repetitive thoughts of being drunk were left out.,book
2953,"I felt this book and story line were tedious.  I became very bored and aggravated with the constant description of the main character's alcoholism.  I realize it was integral to the plot, but it became a character in the storyline.  If a person can wade through the first three quarters of the book, the last quarter is excellent.",book
4905,"I wish we could give half stars because I would give this 3.5 I was disappointed in this book. I appreciated the plot twists but sadly, the language was ordinary. This book was certainly no ""Gone, Girl."" I guess I was taken in by all the buzz. Nicely put together but the characters left me cold, despite the fact that they were unlikeable (my weakness). Train metaphor overdone and annoying but a good read nonetheless.",book

1639,"What happened to an intriguing plot? Why was this book published? The characters were relatively flat and mostly unlikable. I feel like I just wasted several hours of my life reading this book. The writing wasn't terrible but it wasn't great, either. I got no satisfaction out of this story. Nothing like Gone Girl in terms of a (somewhat) satisfying story.",book
3883,"The heroine is sappy and predictable, and afforded little depth besides her trite ""daddy"" issues, unconditional romanticism of her dysfunctional marriage, and eye-roll inducing alcoholism. Still, she is not unlikeable as a companion for a day at the beach. The plot easily picks up from any distractions you may encounter. It reads like a summer flick, and the biggest element of this plodding mystery is what actors will play the leading roles. Cotton candy, summer reading.",book
2812,"It was a great book, page turner, and when I wasn't able to read I was using the narrator as I drove down the street. I have had a terrible time finding something that even comes close tot his book since. It was very suspenseful with believable characters. If you like suspense you will like this book.",book
4677,"The Girl on the Train was one of those books I just couldn't put down!  Every time I thought I had figured things out, another facet of the story came up and changed my guess.

1057,"A little on the dark side, but read it in two days! Can be a little tough to follow the dates at times as it jumps back and forth (found myself flipping around quite a bit to figure out where I was). Overall, very entertaining read. Purchased another copy as a gift for a mystery-loving family member! Heard it is similar to Gone Girl, but heard others liked Gone Girl better.",book
1877,If the story moved a little faster I would have given it a better score.  The story focuses around an alcoholic with little communication with others until about the middle of the book.  She knows she is an alcoholic with no life but does nothing to make her life better.  She basically sabotages anything positive in her life.  The last part of the book is the best part as that is when the most action occurs.  It's not hard to figure out the ending.  I wouldn't totally write this book off as it was an okay read.  I will admit to skipping some pages as they dragged on going nowhere.,book
1666,"I wasn't sure that I would like this story, it was too Gone Girl for me, but then I read on. This story was a roller coaster slide through a crazy world. Some turns were predictable, others were not. It was a great read!",book
314,"This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing.",book
448,I do recommend the book. It is easy to read and  keeps you in good suspense for a while. The end is a little predictable.,book
4391,"I'm not sure where to begin.  Anything I write will not do justice to this VERY intriguing story.A daily commute on a train to satisfy a voyeurism habit of a lonely girl turns into a mystery, love story, heartache, thriller all rolled into one tightly written package.I've read it twice.  Yes, it's that good, and justly deserves a spot on the best sellers list.",book
4406,Wish I'd seen the film first. I wanted to slap the main character for most of the time.,book

23,"Everyday, Rachel takes the train to work. As the train comes to halt at a signal, she daydreams about the people in the houses she sees. She watches the moments of their lives that she observes from the train, and she makes up stories about them. This is merely daydreaming, until the day she witnesses something. Then, everything changes!As I read this, I kept thinking about that voyeuristic quality that I enjoyed in Hitchcock�s REAR WINDOW. We all seem to enjoy looking into other people�s lives and catching a glimpse of what a stranger�s private life might be like.This book kept me guessing until the last minute. Because the author narrated different chapters in the first person by three alternating characters, we are able to get to know them from the inside out, understand how their minds work, and see how they evolve as the tension of the murder mystery builds. This is a very clever way to both allow the reader to relate to the characters and their feelings, as well as to tell a story from varying viewpoints. I bet you can�t put this one down! I couldn�t!",book
4437,I liked the detail and imagery. I felt like I was right there with all the characters. The date switching was a little confusing I kept forgetting when it was... i recommend this for people who like a good mystery and suspense.,book
320,Got this book to read before seeing the movie. Loved it!,book
627,Ending a little bit unbelievable.  Otherwise suspenseful.  Great character development.  Can't wait to see how movie develops plot and suspense,book
4256,If I'd have watched it as a movie I wouldn't feel so bad about wasting my time reading it and it would have been the same.  The characters did not have much depth to them.  No surprises in this book one knew who the killer was from the beginning.,book
4990,"Finally finished. It was a bit confusing at times, jumping from one characters perspective to another until I sorted them out . Main character a bit pitiful.The characters were well written and interesting. At times it did seem to drag on. The ending ties all the pieces together quite well. Main character still a bit pitiful. All in all I enjoyed it.",book
716,"On the plus side while I could put this book down I did feel a compelling need to go back and finish it.  There is an engaging mystery and a truly scary climax.  Three stars for that.On the minus side--the three main characters are women who in a sense are clones of each other--totally focused on the man in their lives and on actual or wished for children.  No careers, no quirks.  Weak and drippy.  The overall mood of the book is depressing.  When these characters did something strong it was either recklessly stupid or out of character.There is also the Agatha Christie clich� of the culprit at the end spilling the beans about what really happened while someone is (figuratively) tied to the railroad tracks.  That was old with Agatha Christie.The originality and unique take on contemporary life that you'll find in Gone Girl is simply not here, plus the whole view of life and women's lives in particular is just a downer.  The writing is okay but the three narrators all are alike in how they express themselves.",book
1923,"This book was amazing.  I don't want to over-hype it but it really was a ""can't put this down till 2 am even though I have to be up at 7"" type of book.  For me at least. It could possibly be because I really didn't care for the book I read right before this one (The Girl in Cabin 10).  This was so much better.  It really kept me guessing up until almost the very end, and then at the VERY end there is a nice satisfying twist.  That's all I can say without spoiling it.. It's our next Book Club book and we are going to go see the movie as well!",book
4022,"This book was recommended to me several times and it did not disappoint. I couldn't put it down and finished it much faster than I've finished any book in the last few years. If you're a fan of Gone Girl, you'll love this.",book
2229,"I though this was OK but not up to all the hype the book's received. It's not another Gone Girl, to which it's often compared and which I believe had more twists and better developed characters. But the concept was fascinating, as anyone who's ever looked out a train window and wondered about the lives of people living in houses near the tracks can appreciate. But I guessed the ""surprise"" about midway through, and I felt the story did drag in places. Nonetheless, it's a good beach read for this summer!",book
640,"Since the novel was proclaimed as the next Gone Girl, I was eager to get started since I loved that book. Rather than a real psychological thriller, it turned out to be a regular who dun it..not the type of literature that I typically enjoy.Although there was an interesting mix of women, all who were suffering in some way because of motherhood, some of the sections seemed to drag on and on.As the author portrayed the alcoholic binges of the main character, I believe that she wanted us, too, caught in the downward spiral.  That worked the first one of two times around, but then became a drudge to read.If the who dun it genre is your reading style, you will probably enjoy it.  For me, it was just okay.",book
3237,"I wasn't expecting much when I picked this book up to read. I just wanted to read it before the movie was released. Now I'm hoping, but not expecting, the movie to be as good as the book. The twists and turns are definitely worth wading through some fairly depressing storyline. Well done.",book
4521,"So much more than I expected! I have to admit I did figure it out right before the end. At first, I was disgusted with Rachel and then I began to see what had happened to her. A great story in that it shows how life is not always how it seems or appears. After I finished reading the story, I thought about Rachel for days afterwards. Very intense story.",book
3800,"Since the moment I started it, I could hardly stop.  I finished it in four days (and I went to work and everything) It is very original, the characters are well developed and you know there is something more, but it is hidden very deep.  Some things are difficult to believe, but you will dont care.  The story is interesting, and it has plot twists all the time.  My feelings for the characters changed all the time, sometimes I understood and supported them, sometimes I got very annoyed with them.  Rachel, the girl on the train, is a real mess, and sometimes you will want to punch her!  Read it, you will not regret!!",book

2941,"Honestly, I just bought this book to read it again because I borrowed it from a friend a while back, and I was so excited to dig in, which I did. I had seen all the hype surrounding it. But, honestly, I don't get the hype...at least not the first time around. I'm hoping I'll enjoy it more this time...I'm all about second chances. But, the characters aren't as developed as I wanted them to be and were predictable. It was a good book, just not as good as the hype suggests. But, here goes round two. I hope I find what I missed the first time.",book
2117,"...were not my book group's chosen novel this month.  It's a good Page Turner but has too many unreliable narrators.  Also I found the time line annoying. One narrator's  time line was not chronological with the others. I had to keep flipping back to pay attention to the dates. Also too many obsessed female victims, for my taste in this day and age. But maybe that is who I would recommend it too, women who are codependent, but it could harm their psyches also. For mystery fans it's a very good ""Who Done It?""",book
4202,I was hesitant to read this at first because I read a bad review but I'm so glad I changed my mind! This book sucked me in and took me for a great ride. I love the different perspectives and really didn't have it figured out until the very end.,book
3628,"Twisty turny...quite a ride. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Trying to say what it is that makes it such a page-turner is impossible for me, but it is definitely a book to put on your list. Such realistic characters in such unrealistic situations, but, at the same time...how the hell did they get there?  I loved it. I recommend it as a great story. A great read.",book
4477,The most amusing fact about this book is that each character had flaws. The plot kept you interested and you couldn't help but root for Rachel to get her life in order. The common theme that keeps repeating is that not everything is as it seems when looked at from a distance.The book had several twists and jumped back and forth in time. I enjoyed the story as well as the pace that it was told. It gave the reader time to feel like they met each one of the main characters. Enjoyable and suspenseful.,book
2728,"In my opinion it has a slow beginning. It consists of three main characters, but it goes back and forth in time which is hard to keep up when you don't have time to read the book in one sitting. Somehow you kind of know who the killer is, but you want to read the entire book. Interesting. First time reading Paula Hawkins.",book

3408,"A decent murder mystery book, but I've read better. The development of the characters were alright. I thought that the author forced the main chapter to do certain things that were just unrealistic and odd to get to the proper ending. It was a page turner and I didn't realize that I wasnt a fan until I finished the book. I would only recommend this book to people who read a lot other wise I don't think you will find it enjoyable.",book

4671,Very predictable. I figured out who the killer was right away. Very repetitive,book
2614,"This book really needed a strong-willed editor . It  takes us through endless instances of the same  kind of dysfunctional behavior of the alcoholic principal character, till it became excruciatingly boring to keep reading.  Especially since, by the time you're about two thirds through the book, you have a pretty good idea of who the villain is.",book
1275,"When I started this book, I was excited by the main characters and the first person accounts of events. I love that the main character was an alcoholic and not your typical heroine. However, the last quarter of the book was so disjointed and incongruous from the first 3/4 of the book, including a complete overhaul of Rachel, the alcoholic, that it felt like an incomplete, cheap and rushed version of the first part of the book. Promising beginning, disappointing ending.",book
3620,"All 5 main characters--3 women and 2 men--are incredibly hapless.  Only believabla character is a minor one, Cathy the roomate of the ""heroine"".  Writing confusing because it jumps from person to persona as narrator and year to year..  Plot unlikely.",book
4537,"Reading A Girl on the Train is a fast moving train! You cannot put the book down once you start and you will be amazed at the pace you travel through this book. I've not picked up a book I've whipped through like I did with this one, in many years. The book is fun, filled with mystery and  quirky characters. Each chapter empties you out into the stream-of-consciousness, first-person thoughts of several of the characters (one per chapter). I could not wait to see who 'done' it and you won't be able to either! Read it--you won't be sorry.",book
2085,"I loved The Girl on the Train and wasn't able to put it down-- I read it in just a couple days! I can't remember the last time I read a book that quickly. Hawkins' writing style was fluid and easy to follow, and I never felt bored by the book or like it was a chore to read it. Quite the contrary, I was engrossed by the story, felt empathy for the protagonist, and relished the mystery within the pages. Highly recommend!",book
2632,"A real page turner.  Complicated main character fueled by alcohol makes sometimes good and sometimes totally erroneous conclusions.  What is real and what is her drunken imagination?

2995,"For those who like Gillian Flynn, I highly recommend this book. For those looking for redeemable characters, sympathetic even in the slightest vein, and for complete, grammatically correct sentences, this book is not for you. For those accustomed to complex characters, complex dialogue and mellifluous language, do not even think about picking this one up. I think this book started out in a melancholy way, sunk to depression and by the end, even with the fun twist, the book found its way to a place even lower than depression. I think, though, this would make a good thriller movie.",book
927,"I am in the minority that didn't love this book.  It was slow in places and the final twist fell flat for me.  I guessed the person about half way through and was disappointed to find out that I was right.  I did like the feeling of being the person on the train who is playing Nancy Drew to help solve the mystery, however the drunken blackouts became predictable and made me skim the pages a bit.  I enjoyed the writing, however I would not call this the next Gone Girl.  I do not think the writing quality or story telling is anywhere near that of Gillian Flynn.  I think if you are looking for a Flynn style psychological thriller, you should pick up Mud Vein or Marrow by Tarryn Fisher.  The Girl On The Train is not as dark and twisted as I was hoping it to be.",book
1689,I was anxious to read the book as there was so much pre publication hype. I think overall it was just disappointing. I found the chapters jumping from woman to woman sometimes confusing. The story line had so many characters and really none embraced me. I am still trying to figure out the man on the train. Predictable characters....ending a bit far fetched....just disappointing!,book
2007,"I really wanted to like this book, I really did.  I was intrigued enough to finish it because I wanted to know who dunnit, but there were many times I wanted to put it down and just walk away.  After finishing it, I was left with a feeling of let-down. I could have cleaned the house and gained more satisfaction with the use of my time.  I realize the world is not always a pretty place, but the characters in the book did nothing to inspire me.",book
3023,"A fast-paced novel, fun to read as you try to elucidate the mystery along with the main character. The author weaves together in her novel such contemporary issues as loneliness, alcoholism, adultery, and somehow manages to create a story line that is engaging and keeps you reading way into the night.",book
1829,"A slog of a read.  I stuck with it to the very end, but it's only really gripping in the last 2% (I read on Kindle).  The timeline can be ignored--it adds nothing but confusion and helps the reader not in the least.  The writing is pedestrian.  The characters not sharply delineated, they tend to blend into each other.  And enough with the booze motive.  It got it right away, and the author just belabors the same stuff over and over.  Probably better off if you pay the money for the movie.  The cost would be similar, it will take less of your time, plus you can have popcorn.  Not recommended.",book
4084,"Slow start.  Took me awhile to get the gist of the main characters.  My feelings for the main character were sympathy and empathy.  I felt like I was feeling her pain but then every time she drank, I was angry with her.  Excellent story with a surprising ending.",book

Then I watched the previews for the movie and I couldn't wait any longer so I bought the book. I'm so glad I did. The book is a bit confusing at first but it certainly keeps you guessing.,book
2255,"I started this book several times and put it down. Finally finished it because I thought it might improve as I read further. Unfortunately not. Difficult to convey exactly how annoying the three main characters (women) were, although in truth they are all the same woman.

Don't read too many reviews. Just read it.",book
3116,"Wow! This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down and wanted to read it any chance I could. It was suspenseful! The main character, Rachel witnesses a couple outside their home every day from a stop on a train and becomes a bit obsessed with their lives. She names them and imagines what they are like. She envies them since her own marriage failed. The funny thing is, her exhusband remarried and lives right near this couple.  But then the lady she often sees, Megan, goes missing! It's a mystery and an obsession for Rachel. She gets to be a part of their lives through lies and her obsessive snooping. She is an unreliable narrator since she also has a bit of a problem with getting flat-out blackout no memory drunk. Such a treat to read. You will be bummed out once you finish it : (",book

855,"This was one of those books that is hard to review. All of the characters were horrible people, not a likable person in the bunch. But yet there were times I could not put it down, wondering what would  happen next.  Would I recommend it?  I'm not sure. It was different, but somewhat akin to Gone Girl. If you read that book, you will know what I mean about unlikable characters. A bit of a ""train wreck"" pun intended, several bad marriages, a drunk you just want to slap sometimes, mental abuse, it's got all that! If you like dysfunctional people, this book might just be for you.",book
2907,"Not the usual genre I read but I enjoyed this book! The story kept me very engaged and I  cared ""who done it""!  Several scenarios were plausible! The concept was original. The narrative alternated between three of the main characters and the things were tied up at the end.  The writing style was perfect for the story.  Some characters were  better developed than others and  some plot details were a little shaky but overall, this was a fun read.",book
4453,Bought this book based on the reviews.  Kept on reading it thinking it would get better but after more than half way through I gave it up..  I really don't get why this book is popular.  Psychological thriller... you got to be kidding.  It's just page after page of personal rambling by two self obsessed characters.  I did not care about the characters and the plot was flimsy at best.,book
758,"It was a downer for the most part .  Rachels alcohol issues were way overstated, and none of the characters wereParticularly likeable.  They all seemed needy, spoiled, neurotic, or vacant.  What I disliked most was that she waspretty vague at the beginning when you were trying to figure things out, and then she discloses pertinent information toward the end. For a mystery writer, it's sort of a cheating tactic. Better to have good clues throughout the book that continue to unfold to build the mystery evenly.  It was very spotty and uneven,and none of the characters had much depth or character!",book
2854,"I rated this book as 5 Stars because it is well worth it. If the movie is anything like the book all I can say is Wow!!! Memory loss, alcohol, train rides, and old loves. Unhappy ex wife, drinks to much, tells lies, and imagines things or is it the truth. Like murder, like suspense then read this book.",book
123,"I was very disappointed. I read the reviews and thought from the ratings this was a safe bet. After completing the long and dreary story I felt the reviewers who believed this to be a great thriller really haven't read one. Sorry, but this story did nothing for me except wear me out. Very repetitive...",book
2925,LOVE this book. Cannot wait for the movie. I read this novel when Gone Girl was popular.  I felt that The Girl on the Train had much better character development.  When reading the two novels within weeks of the other I really enjoyed The Girl on the Train much more.  Gone Girl was a disappointment in comparison.,book
4719,The book was ok...a bit predictable...pathetic characters...dismal setting...not quite sure how I really feel.  I guess the storyline was interesting but the main characterwas so sad...but then being an alcoholic is sad.  In fact every character had such a troubled past that you almost  couldn't believe  how they could function at all.  This is also a sad review!!!,book
1755,"I've heard such good reviews about this book but it's torture to force myself to get through it just so I can say ""I've read this book"".  I want to like it but I'm feeling a bit ""meh"" about it.  Over and over again about the main character's drunken antics.  Please.... just get me to the end.  I'm hopeful I may someday finish it, but for now, this is my opinion.  And I'm pretty sure I know how it's going to end.",book

819,"At first I thought, oh no, it's Gone Girl set outside of London. That comparison quickly faded as this book is actually better. The flawed main protagonist helps. Actually all the characters are flawed, rendering them both unreliable and sympathetic. This unreliability, drawn up through actual physical reasons for doubt to reasons of lies, emotional distance, and lack of information on a character serves as a constant feed for the tension and its consistent throughout all the diary-like entries.I generally dislike dates as chapter headings. It's just another thing to keep track of and my mind quickly reads over them (hence I forget them straight away) because I hurry right to the ""juicy stuff."" And this book has lots of juicy bits, but the dates ARE important and I made an effort to keep track.5 stars is not quite enough to give this book, I'd say 7-9 was closer out of an imaginary 10.",book

834,"It is both frustrating and enticing to see Rachel's efforts to remember that fateful night. The night she was drunk (again) and a woman disappeared. Rachel meddles with the investigation... sort of... because she liked to watch the woman and her husband from her seat on the London train. Although a couple of houses away live her ex-husband and his new wife and baby, and she kind of stalks them, too. So much sorrow and confusion...I thought the novel was brilliant in depicting an alcoholic's struggle, on top of the ""whodunnit"" story itself. Rachel is both creepy and pitiable. As much of a ""loser hero"" as she was, I found myself rooting for her.My only disappointment came at the end, which was way too drawn-out and gore for my taste. Once we know who's done it, please, wrap it up. Otherwise a really good thriller.",book

3355,The book was a solid read however it took me a month to read it as some parts of it was very slow paced. I thought the ending could have been more thought out. It really seemed rushed and that the author got lazy. Overall solid book. I would recommended it to others. I'm hoping the movie will be better.,book
2680,"It was a great story. I can't believe I finished it. I want more. I'm still in shock at the twist in the end. I don't like disturbing story lines with lots of blood or heart wrenching topics. It's a smooth read with a great story line. Not too disturbing, not too much blood or sex. You'll only stay up at night from being unable to put the book down, not from nightmares. I just loved it. I can't wait for the movie to come out.",book

I�m usually the type of person who can�t predict an ending in a mystery and I�m almost always surprised with where it goes. Not so with this book. The plot is not too complicated, so it�s perfect for laid-back summer brain where you might not be completely engaged every time you pick up the book.

752,"Ugh, the best part of this book is that it eventually ends and you feel better.  To me, the mystery notwithstanding, the hardest thing about this book was how incredibly hard it was to like ANY of the characters.  I find it very hard to read a book when I'm not able to really root for anyone.  But, I thought it was a decent enough mystery.  Didn't figure it out way in advance of the end but the possible murderers that the reader is supposed to suspect come across as so deliberately red herrings.  So it becomes a game of who's left after you eliminate the other possible suspects.  If this were not a book group selection I probably wouldn't have finished.  However, it gets two stars instead of one from me because at the end, I did develop some empathy for our drunken heroine.  So, there was that.",book
242,"I can't imagine comparing this book to Gone Girl! They have nothing in common whatsoever, other than the fact that both are written in a way that you don't like the main characters. But this is part of the interest in Gone Girl - you want to keep reading to see what happens to these awful people. Here, I hated the characters, but I wanted to finish quickly and move on to another book.I found the plot unbelievable. Why would the police not arrest this drunk woman for interfering with their investigation? Perhaps things are different in Britain, but I don't think US cops would allow her to keep wandering (or should I say staggering) into their investigation. The ""evidence"" she has to offer is so very flimsy, the fact that the author tries to force it into this investigation becomes annoying long before the book ends.If you haven't read Gone Girl, read it! If you have read Gone Girl, pick something else from whatever genre you enjoy. It will probably be better than this one!!",book
1164,It's probably not a good idea for me to review this book. From the fact that it is on the best seller list shows how well received it must be by readers. I personally found it very well written but much too dark for me. I was depressed the entire time I was reading it. The character doesn't have a redeeming quality. She's a falling down drunk and makes no attempt to help herself. How her friend could have been so patient after she threw up in the foyer didn't ring true to me at all.  I think for many people that would have done it.,book
3767,The Girl on the Train is written in a style of chapters titled by characters in the novel. (This is not my favorite style) so I approached the first few chapters with passive attention. As I got into the book the characters drew me in. The author held the solution to the crime until the end. Characters were well developed and one could relate to their characteristics. I enjoyed the book and recommend it if you like mysteries that end when it ends.,book
1371,"At first I hated this book.  It jumped back and forth betwen times and characters, really hard to keep track.  If you don't like this sort of book then this book is not for you.  It took me half way through to start liking it.  It was a real whodunit mystery.  The character of the Girl (on the train) was not especially likable.  Of course I have a problem with alcohholics.  She was weak and annoying.  Not only was she weak but she wanted to go to bed with every man she saw.  They way I am talking you must think why did this reviewer give it a 4.  Well I wanted to give it a 3 plus but you can't do that.  The ending was good though or should I say the last 1/2 of the book.",book

1308,"The Girl on the Train is yet another twist on the classic whodunit. The story is told through the point of view of three women, each with their own flaws and secrets. We meet Rachel Watson, a drunk, unemployed, divorcee who daydreams about the ""perfect"" life of Jess and Jason - a couple she only knows by seeing them from the train every day. When Jess (Megan Hipwell) turns up missing, Rachel takes it upon herself to solve the case. Through a series of lies and deceit, Rachel finds herself face to face with a cast of male characters (all deeply flawed themselves), anyone of whom could be the killer.My thoughts on the book:The writing style is just horrendous and completely unnecessary. The entire book is written in first person, though our POV switches between the three female characters: Rachel, Megan, and Anna. This can lead to confusion when the action flips back and forth. Had this use of first person worked to reveal something about the characters that could just not be said through third-person omniscient, it could have worked. But it was complicated by the fact that each chapter was broken into ""Morning"" and ""Evening"", so the tense switched back and forth between present and past tense. I get that breaking it up this way reflects the two train trips, one in to the city, one back home, but it is unnecessary as most of the action takes place off the train. These two combined makes it difficult to read.This is Hawkins' first novel, and it shows. The bland writing style bored me to death, and it took everything I had in me to finish the book. Stephen King can spend 80% of a book writing about nothing and I love every word of it. Hawkins drew out a boring story where we learn to hate every character involved. Not a single character has a good redeeming quality.I was genuinely surprised when the killer was revealed. I was not shocked, however, and this is a huge negative. When I read the reveal in ""Gone Girl"", I had to put the book down. I could not continue because I had to process what I had just read. I have had this happen in many other books. Good fiction is emotional. You feel shocked because you're so invested in the story and characters. Here, I was just glad it was over.Conclusions:I read this book simply because the movie is coming out soon and it was well known and liked. I was disappointed throughout, and expected much more. There are many things (see above) that could have improved this book. The plot was not bad, it was just poorly developed. The characters were not unbelievable, but they sure were unlikable. The style and prose were atrocious; nothing short of a full rewrite could have saved that.Read at your own risk. If being part of the crowd is more important to you than reading quality fiction, this is your book.",book
1143,I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.  It's pointless.  I couldn't have cared less about the characters or the story.  I read a number of reviews comparing this to Gone Girl.  Not even close.  I loved that book.,book
3110,Great for seeing how wonderfully quick crazy turns into addiction turns into ruined LIVES. Thoroughly enjoyed it though but then I'm not an addict - by the grace of God! If you see yourself as a character in this book please please please seek professional help.,book
3618,This was a riveting story.  What I appreciated most was the authors brilliant use of literary techniques to masterfully craft a narrative that was taught and tense from about page 50 on;  and she did it without cheating.  No Deus Ex Machina - no implausible explanations; just a tightly woven story that revealed its darkness in increments.,book
4389,"I didn't really connect with the main character.  She's fat, drunk , and unattractive. She's just pathetic. I enjoyed how each chapter was written from each girl's point of view, but that's about it.  There's nothing shocking about the plot line. It's just kinda eh, meh, blah......",book
57,"The only reason I didn't stop reading this book after the first 100 pages is because I kept thinking surely this novel will pick up it's pace at some point.  Not this novel.  Slow moving, very predictable and lame.  The one positive I can say is good character development.  I do not recommend this novel.",book
994,Very slow read.Too much repetition. Disappointed,book
4304,"The beginning of the story drove me somewhat crazy, too.  The choices of the main character, while in alcoholic stupors, were one ridiculous thing after another.

2912,"No one escapes suspicion in this tale of romance, jealousy, deceit, murder and revenge. In  Paula Hawkins' hand the pen is a lethal weapon as  shespares none of her characters sufficient weakness and motive to betray, seduce and murder not once but twice and then...each time the Girlon the Train arrives the story shifts... the mystery deepens. Not a book one puts away easily! Not a villain so quickly exposed.  Excellent piece of writing!",book
1605,"For the life of me I cannot understand how this book has been a top seller for so long.  I read A LOT.  And I would not consider this a great piece of fiction by any means.  It is soooo repetitive I felt like I was reading the same words over and over and over again until the last couple of chapters when the mystery finally unravels.  This entire story could have been told in 50 pages or less.... I get that the main character is supposed to be a messed-up alcoholic and she has a lot to regret but come on, people.  This is not best-seller material.",book
4145,This sounded like my kind of mystery book.  What ruined it for me was the main character.  I couldn't sympathize or empathize with her at all.  I know she had some issues but she was constantly getting hit on the head and/or drinking herself into oblivion.  It wasn't until the end that she finally did something about her situation.  I liked the authors writing but not the story - I found it very depressing.,book
1874,I wound up putting down the book. Too wordy for me and too focused on the character's drinking. Expected something quicker paced and less psychological. I love English mysteries but this wasn't the one for me.,book
3671,It's depressing & graphic. Every male character is seen as abusive in some way. All 3 female characters' voices sound the same to me. The only one that differed a bit was Anna.  But if you past all that a great murder mystery!,book

The more I read, the more I wanted to continue reading until the end. I give this book only 4 stars because I was expecting more of a shocking twist at the end, given all the hype about this book. I had the ending figured out long before it was revealed. Even with my disappointment at the ending, I would still highly recommend this book.",book

3619,"The Girl On The Train is a very readable ""can't put it down"" book. Many of the feelings and observations of the main character are easy to identify with - it's hard to empathize completely with someone who has no self-esteem and continually sabotages herself. Yet she continues on because she has some knowledge deeply buried that is nagging at her. That is part of the twisty-turning fascination of the mystery.",book
4972,"Without an entirely loveable heroine, the narrative was both fascinating and, at times, infuriating.  Ultimately, this led toan intriguing, somewhat dark, and truly well developed story, full of twists and surprises.

4600,Loved this book. Liked the way Paula Hawkins told one story from the prospective of several characters and became each one of the characters separately in the story. Instead of the usually narrative of a floating outsider or just the prospective of one telling the story. crescendoed masterfully as it spun and tied loose ends.,book
4012,"I had read so much about this book that I was expecting great things so I was a little disappointed at first. But then, the more I read the better the book got and I hope I'm not pushing this too far, but it moved along faster and faster the more I read - like a train gaining speed. I have to say there were some elements of Gone Girl, but only fleetingly. The best part was I never guessed the perpetrator so it was a big surprise. Overall, really enjoyed this book.",book
4697,"Pretty good, moderately suspenseful book with some twists, though not particularly difficult to figure out.  Liked the writing and the pace, and thought the story hummed along nicely.

I enjoyed the book because it was not clear who the bad guy(s) was until the book was almost done.

It took half the book to set the stage - too long for me.  I continued reading and finally, painfully finished it.  There are twists and turns.  The ending was a surprise.

Nice writing and a great story.",book
756,"This was an enjoyable book with plenty of twists and turns to keep me turning the pages. While there were parts of the book that were predictable, Hawkins does a nice job of keeping the reader guessing about the outcome. While at times I wanted to know more about certain characters in the book, they were developed well enough that i found myself connecting with them emotionally from start to finish. The story is told from the viewpoints of the three main female characters (Rachel, Megan and Anna), which adds to the mystery and emotion of the story. The pace of this book is enjoyable - while I was eager to get to the end of the story, at the same time, there were moments when taking a rest from the sadness that often defined Rachel's life became necessary for me emotionally. It was a good book, and a relatively quick read.",book

Now I need to find another book that I can read leisurely!",book
2467,"The story has three men who are all evil in some way, and all the female character's problems are somehow a product of the evil created by the two men in the story. I was really excited about reading this book as it was compared it to Gone Girl. The main character is pathetic in every way (thanks to the men in the story, I'm sure if asked, the author would say the main character had a horrible father as well,) I love the ENDING where, the main character is running away from a noise she heard in the bushes, showing how she's now paranoid and traumatized by her ex boyfriend, and then it just ends. I hated this book.",book
1086,"I am disappointed in this book.Though Hawkins's approach is refreshingly unique in terms of pacing and perspective, her reliance on stereotypes of men as violent and abusive and women as insecure, overly emotional, and erratic ruined this one for me.",book

108,"The Girl on the Train fits into what I call ""junkfood literature"" - not gonna change your life, but it's a fun, easy read.  The writing is good.  The narration dragged along in some parts, but overall it held enough suspense to keep me basically hooked til the end.  Although it was entertaining and fresh, it was depressing and left me just, well . . . depressed.  If you don't mind that, give it a chance.  I won't count Paula Hawkins out for future books.  The ending even left a bit of room for a possible sequel.",book
1184,"This Girl on the Train was a bit confusing at first because the story is being told through the eyes of three different characters: Rachel, Megan and Anna so the story seemed disorganized at first.

The plot was also really good and the ending intriguing right up until the very end! All in all, I definitely recommend this book!",book

1277,"After the first twenty pages or so, I asked myself how much more pathetic could the author make the character Rachel. But there was method to this insanity as a murder mystery developed and Rachel inserted herself into its solution in the most inept ways.It took me a while before I realized it was written in the first person from the perspective of three different woman and that it was jumping from the present to a few months in the past. Once I got that straightened out, it started to make sense.The pace picked up toward the end and it turned out to be a well-written thriller. I wouldn't give it five stars because it dragged a bit, but it certainly deserves at least four.",book
2239,"Trash. When the perpetrator performs a confessional soliloquy with 10 minutes left in the book, you realize that the writer was stumped as to how to resolve any mystery that may have remained at that point and took the easy way out. There is no literary merit to the novel whatsoever. In spite of this, the book moves quickly and manages to evoke a mild guilty engagement (hey - it IS a murder story), which is apparently the inspiration for most of the positive reviews. Hitchcock?! Are you kidding? If there's a crime and a window...?",book

3391,I actually loved everything about this book. I loved that it dipped in and out along the timeline. I liked the differing character views. The story was gripping and compelling and it really did keep you guessing until the end. I would absolutely recommend this book!,book
4194,"The story started slowly and was confusing because it kept changing characters.  It was written as each character was telling a story from their point of view.  I kept reading the book because it did become more interesting as the story progressed.  The ending pleased and surprised me, it was a mystery that I never would have thought about.",book
2389,"After months of seeing/hearing friends talk about this book, I finally got a copy to read. This book is so amazing, I read it in a day and a half. I could not put it down! The characters are incredibly complex and just when you think you've got them figured out, a new twist comes in. The writing style is fantastic as well. You truly feel as if you are in the characters shoes when reading. I can't wait for the movie now!!",book
2808,"Loved the story and it kept me on my toes. I did not want to put this book down and when it finally ended, everything was clear to me and I did not feel like there was unfinished business. I have yet to watch the movie and read this book before knowing it was going to be a film.",book
3362,"This suspenseful book is great ! It keeps you staying up late to read this page turner! If you loved Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl or Dark Places, you will love this read! It is worth the read even with all the hype surrounding it. Enjoy your next read!",book
1804,"Over 20,000 people can't be wrong. Check out the sample, you'd end up buying the book. I needed a change in the category of novels I had been selecting and this was it. Suspenseful, a smidge dark, with pieces of surprises here and there. The plot and the characters are like something I have not experienced before. If you identify with the main character(s), the book is that much better. No story is perfect, with the exception of a few exceptional pieces, but I'm rating this a 5-star because this one make me want to pick up another suspenseful novel.",book
4123,It took me a long while to get into the story but then bam all of a sudden couldn't put it down until it was finished.  Great book has your mind twisting and turning.  Glad I read the book and did not go see the movie.  Excellent.,book
2172,"I have to tell you, when I started reading this book, the only thing I could keep thinking was how this will be a terrible read for me ... the absolute desperation of depressed, alcoholic Rachel makes you want to cry for her and do whatever you can to actively not become her. She passes her husband and his new wife's street each day and has a glimpse of another couple's home, who she aptly names ""Jess and Jason,""  Jess and Jason are perfect, until Jess goes missing and Rachel slowly comes to realize that they weren't perfect at all.The book is definitely a suspense/thriller type, but it also has elements of despair and drama that those who don't normally love thrillers can get on board with.  It just takes such sharp turns and all of the sudden you're like, ""How did I not see that before?""The characters are utterly unlikeable, but that was part of the charm of the book ... aside from Rachel, who mostly grows on you, Anna is close to sociopathic in her utter desperation to be a trophy wife and perfectly judgmental mother, and Megan was also mentally unstable in her own right, but not nearly as bad as Anna.  The whole book leaves you baffled at the end, and kind of wishing it had been longer and more drawn out.  Overall, I highly recommend.  It's ""Gone Girl"" with more characters and a slightly more watery plot.",book
3914,"Every mystery has u guessing the possible ending that is waiting for the reader, waiting for the characters. The girl on this train has you guessing what happened in the beginning, what really occurred in the middle, what does each chapter insinuate...guessing till the end",book
2570,"Great suspense and fantastic descriptions make this a winner. A story of three women who are in an unlikely, tangled relationship with the men in their lives. Story is told predominately by Rachel, a young alcoholic divorcee who rides the train into London and back each day...for no other reason than to insinuate she has a job which in truth, she lost sometime ago. It is what she witnesses from the window of the train that makes this story so stunningly mysterious in a Hitchcock sort of way. As the plot unravels and the suspense increases, one cannot be sure just who is to blame for the murder of another of the women. It seems there are not enough motives but too many lies. In the end, the conclusion is a breath taking revelation into the mind of someone so deeply dark and disturbed, you wonder how two of the women survived at all.",book
4284,"Despite its popularity, I found this book distinctly unpleasant and unenlightening.  Though it was reasonably well written, I thought the technique of alternating chapters from different time periods didn't have much purpose, except perhaps to build some tension that would not otherwise have been there had the events been in chronological order.  The women in the book were shallow, foolish,  and dependent, the men's characters only sketchily drawn.  I thought the book worked as a mystery, but not in other ways, and the characters had few, if any, redeeming characteristics.",book
943,"I really enjoyed this novel.  There's already tons of in-depth reviews, so I'm not going to do that.  I will say that at the beginning I was saying to myself, well this is just odd.  But soon I was completely involved and didn't want to put it down.  After I finished, I needed to talk about it, it really stuck with me.  So I googled the title and found a fantastic spoiler discussion and that was a great debrief for me.  It was really great to see what everyone thought of different things.  Specifically, I was shocked when I read that some people knew whodunnit before half way.  I certainly did not identify the person, and only had a pretty good guess before the denouement.  I may read it again.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.",book

It was entertaining at times, but overall just OK.",book

3356,Better written than many mainstream murder mystery novels. However I did have the end figured out by about the middle of the book. Some situations were a little implausible (the widower allowing her to get close is pretty unlikely). This book did keep my interest until the end and overall was an enjoyable read.,book
1372,"The Girl on the Train has been widely compared to Gone Girl, but I wouldn't stop there. This book has a familiar pattern of intrigue and mystery shared by many similar novels. The characters are well-rounded and interesting. The biggest similarity in this novel to Gone Girl is the balance of women who are vulnerable, yet strong. I especially enjoyed the way the story was told from each character's internal dialog. I finished it in a single sitting, drawn in by the complexity of the protagonist, compelled to follow her on her adventure.",book
3396,"This book seemed longish to me, but I still couldn't put it down.  The surprise ending got me.  Nice to have a story where the main character seems to be a complete washout and then comes out on top in the end.

1863,"Writing from the omnipresent point of view is always dicey with authors.  Sometimes there is so much clutter that it is difficult to separate each character.  This book started out a bit cluttered; however, with each chapter labeled by the character speaking, it didn't take too long to listen to each voice.  I wasn't prepared for the ending, though.  Rather gory and unexpected, but a great way to finish.  I found myself looking forward to ""my time"" so I could finish a few more chapters.",book

762,"I really wanted to love this book and had high hopes based on other reader comments.  I greatly enjoyed ""Gone Girl"" but this book pales in comparison.  The 3 female characters with alternating POVs are all pathetic. Their middle class problems seem so first world and were not compelling.  One of the females, Megan, and one of the 2 main male characters, Tom, are conveniently compulsive liars and cheats and no one ever meets the parents or family of either (Megan's family conveniently dead, Tom's estranged) -- it felt so contrived! Then to add the final insult SPOILER ALTER -- pathetic Rachel (who is a white, educated, middle class adult, presumably in her 30's) ends up having everything worked out when her mother coughs up some money for her to get back on her feet and get a fresh start. Rachel didn't do anything real to rebuild her life or improve herself. Saved by mummy's money. Ugh!",book

2537,I was anxious to read the book as there was so much pre publication hype. I think overall it was just disappointing. I found the chapters jumping from woman to woman sometimes confusing.

2891,"that a plot-driven, page-turning yarn cannot also be well written? I admire so much about this book; the wonderful Rear Window premise, the unfolding of the narrative through three points of view, the episodic blackouts that contribute to the protagonist's (and the reader's) inability to sort fact from fiction. Ultimately, though, the novel suffers from a lack of attention to the writing itself - simple cliches, red herrings, characters who fail to maintain their own voices and crash into each other in some sort of ""sisterhood is powerful"" jingoism.

1881,"What a fantastic psychological thriller..I absolutely could not put this one down!! It's very refreshing to see a main character who is somewhat ""flawed""  like the rest of us, for example, alcoholic, overweight, suffering from depression, etc. The rest of the characters have their own demons and crosses to bear as well. The story line kept me enthralled, as the ""suspect"" seems to change minute to minute, keeping me guessing as to whodunit till the very end.

However, had I known it was so full of depressing characters, lying, drinking, cheating, murdering, I wouldn't have wasted my money.  There was not one character that you could really love.  It is suspenseful and you get hooked, but it ends leaving you feeling empty and relieved that it's over.",book
269,"Disappointing after all the hype. The plot was twisted and unpredictable, which was good, but I stopped caring about what happened because the characters were so uninteresting. The story was told from the point of view of three female characters: Rachel, the primary character, was whiny and weak, still pining for a broken marriage with a nasty two-timer; Anna, the woman he cheated with, didn't come to life at all; and Megan, a neighbor of Anna's, seemed to be calmly narrating her fate even while expiring. In any case, I failed to connect with any of them. And the male characters, without giving the ending away, were disturbing and violent. It takes more than these one-dimensional people to make a mystery novel interesting. This one failed to deliver.",book

I knew it would ultimately come together at the end, but I found myself questioning whether the author was trying to be ""sophisticated"" and it was a little unnecessary, because not only did they describe a certain date but also whether it was the morning or evening.  That could've easily been determined if it wasn't broken up into sub-categories but just mentioned in the writing.  I also didn't find too much depth in the characters.  It was clear one of the handful of characters was the guilty party and it wasn't difficult to figure out by process of elimination.  It was a little disappointing. Just my 2c.",book

2873,"I don't like to criticize any author who spends hundreds of hours writing something for readers to enjoy.Clearly, Paula Hawkins' perseverance has paid off for her since she's been on the best seller lists for many months, so who am I to go against public opinion--and the NY Times critic?At the risk of sounding ungrateful, I have to complain a bit.Using an ""unreliable narrator"" device can be tricky. There ARE authors who handle it  really well---( A Pleasure and A Calling by Phil Hogan does this beautifully, for example. ) For me, after reaching the end of Girl on a Train, rather than being delighted at being fooled, I was annoyed.  The narrator's ""inner thoughts,"" aren't really honest ones --she holds information back from whom?  Herself?

2010,"Rachel, the girl on the train, is a divorced, unemployed, blackout alcoholic, who rides the train everyday to her imaginary job. The highlight of her day is viewing a couple from the train as they sit on their terrace. Rachel has given them made-up names and a perfect fantasy life. This couple lives several houses down from the house where she had once lived with her ex-husband, who now lives there with his current wife and child. Rachel had wanted a child desperately and blames her alcoholism on the fact that she couldn't get pregnant. She has a tendency to phone her ex-husband when she is drunk and has actually  broken into his house and taken the child out of it. When the woman from the terrace goes missing, Rachel becomes involved in it to the point of obsession, partly because of her brief memories of her drunken behavior on the night the woman disappeared.  The book is addicting. I could not put it down. Rachel discovers some truths about her life as well as the true murderer.  The characters are all very well developed, but I would have liked to know a bit more about the murderer.  That is my only complaint and it isn't really a complaint. Fascinating main character and one you believe will get her act together when the book ends. The Girl on the Train is so far superior to Gone Girl, a book I found predictable with way too much dialog to make it interesting, that I don't know why it is compared to it.",book

There were a few ""oh, come on"" moments in it, but I still had to see what happened as a result. I did figure out the ending before I got to it (by picking up on a little clue from the author) but I still thought it was well written. I would try another from this author.",book

With the way the format was set up using different perspectives and a dated timeline, I was expecting a little bit better of a twist that was harder to see coming.  I also thought the characters were so cliche in their gender roles.  Very unrealistic portrayal of relationships between spouses which basically painted women in a very unfavorable light almost the entire book.",book
973,"Wow! This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down and wanted to read it any chance I could. It was suspenseful! The main character, Rachel witnesses a couple outside their home every day from a stop on a train and becomes a bit obsessed with their lives. She names them and imagines what they are like. She envies them since her own marriage failed. The funny thing is, her exhusband remarried and lives right near this couple.  But then the lady she often sees, Megan, goes missing! It's a mystery and an obsession for Rachel. She gets to be a part of their lives through lies and her obsessive snooping. She is an unreliable narrator since she also has a bit of a problem with getting flat-out blackout no memory drunk. Such a treat to read. You will be bummed out once you finish it : (",book
403,"I found the character of Rachel to be quite enjoyable, just because she's so difficult to like. In fact, all the characters in this book are difficult to like. They're all flawed. They all do awful things and are general a-holes. Still, you can't help but look at them and wonder if you see pieces of yourself in them. Have you ever cheated on someone? Been cheated on? Lied? Been a little too violent in an argument with a SO? Drunk-dialed/texted an ex, over and over, or just embarrassed yourself by being able to let go? Made a fool of yourself? Came to work hung over and useless? It's a good read, for sure. I'm sure reviewers like to use words like ""unflinching"" to describe it.I personally just enjoy books with characters that beat back the stereotypes. Rachel totally did that. She's overweight and totally makes a fool of herself repeatedly. You're disgusted by her weakness, and yet if you've ever been in a relationship, especially one that ended poorly, you can probably feel a glimmer of understanding.Hollywood will undoubtedly make this into an unrecognizable mess. But oh well, such is life.",book

211,"I bought several books to get through the summer with. For some reason I kept putting this one at the end of the pile.  When I finally took it out,  I thought it was kind of confusing and depressing at that. All I can say is, hang on and keep reading through about the first 60 pages or so or until you just HAVE to know more about what drives these characters!  There is a lot of internal dialogue that goes on that I would think would be completely missed in the film format. You will get to know what makes these characters tick, which in itself is extremely interesting and entertaining. After you get through the first tough beginning and begin to know who's who in the zoo, prepare not to get any sleep until the story ends. This is where it takes off like a locomotive and twists and turns around every bend. Truly a thriller that makes you hold on and gasp for air! By all means, order directly from Amazon NOW!",book
1073,"I'm probably one of the few people who will submit a review like I am about to do. I really don't understand what all the ""hype"" was about this book and I certainly don't understand how this book made it to the top sellers of 2015!  I am an immersion reader and in this case (with this book) I am very glad I was. Half way through reading this book I was going to stop reading and just chalk it up to ""The first book ever that I have never finished."" However, thanks to the wonderful narrators at audible, I trudged through the rest of the book, hoping that it would get better, (and it did, the last 4 chapters! ) Excellent ending! It's  just ashame that the reader has to go through 80 percent of  the main character who's an alcoholic whining, lying, ""falling off the wagon,"" feeling sorry for herself, and waking up to blackouts where she's thrown up! So sorry, not my ""cup of tea as they say!"" The story just seemed to go on and on and I didn't think Megan's (Jess ) whoever, character was defined enough as the others were. I don't know maybe I'm just tired of the whole alcoholic, enabling, dysfunctional relationships, you can look around and find them on every corner, I don't need to read about them! That's just my opinion and I'm sticking to it......",book

978,"This was definitely the best book I have read in a very long time!  From the very beginning, I was captivated by the characters and the suspense.  Paula Hawkins does a wonderful job of developing fascinating characters, and the plot is absolutely amazing, creative and suspenseful.  I had no idea ""who did it"" until very close to the end.  The writing is excellent, and I do hope she will continue to write books, and I will certainly follow her.  I read this book in only a couple days, because I simply could not put it down.  I could've read it even faster if I didn't have a few other things to do from time to time (like cook, clean, etc.)  I'm definitely looking forward to this author's next book.",book

And so it was!A well written, strange story about unlikable people. Yet it was crafted so well that I couldn't put it down and was glad I didn't... though I had predicted the ending correctly.",book
1573,"This novel has spent years as a hardcover and e-book bestseller before being issued in paperback where it is predictably on still another bestseller list.  A movie is also in the works so I doubt what I have to say is going to make an impression.  I won't go into plot details because plot twists are the book's main attraction.  Numerous previous reviews have mentioned that the plot relies on unreliable narration.  However, this narrative technique isn't new and didn't originate will Gillian Flynn whose three novels I much preferred to this one.  Authors such as Wilkie Collins and Agatha Christie have also used it to better effect, and no, I won't mention which novels to avoid spoiling them for you.  Be aware that this novel starts very slowly relying on two quotations before the first chapter to entice the reader to go further.  Maybe it's best to wait for the movie or better yet watch Hitchcock's Rear Window which is far superior to the novella which inspired it  and which has as an added attraction the pre-Perry Mason Raymond Burr.",book
3994,"I regret buying this book, the plot seemed to be interesting and the positive reviews made me think it was worth reading, well, that was not the case. The  way the story is written is really boring, very repetitive, I didn't care for any of the characters. The main character was a drunk looser I struggled to like her but the writer made it impossible, she just kept making the same mistakes over and over again. I kept reading hoping that at some point the story would have a twist, that it would get more interesting... that never happened, at some point you just guess the ending.",book

4819,"A great read. Moves along fast and was done and dusted in two days. The main character is a little annoying in that the author has her tackling dangerous situations on her own and she often is interfering and quite frankly, simple-minded in her relationships.  Despite this, the irritation did not stop any enjoyment of the story and there was another stronger female character there to redeem the first.",book

845,"With all the hype 'The Girl on the Train' had been getting, I wasn't quite sure if it would be something I'd enjoy. Generally I tend to steer away from huge blockbuster books as they are a little more ""safe"" than what I usually enjoy reading. Lucky for me, I decided to see what all the fuss was about, and was sucked into this book from the very beginning. One of the best ""page-turner"" thrillers I've read in quite some time, 'The Girl on the Train' is a fantastic psychological work. Not only a thrilling read, but also a smart one that makes you question how much you might really know about someone - even after you think you know it all.",book
669,"This would probably be considered a psychological thriller, and that it was indeed.  I never guessed what was coming until almost the end of this novel.  The characters were well-developed with great description and  excellent expression of their thoughts and feelings.  The story is told primarily from one person's point of view, but several characters, especially the other two main female characters, also weigh in and add to understanding the story. It is set in London, and the regular commuter train running through the story ties all the characters and settings together.  There is a strong message that you can never fully know what another person's life is like despite how things may seem. It is a creative and absorbing story that was impossible to put down once I got into it.  Highly recommend!",book

I'm so glad I continued to read, not that I was ever able to put it down, but so many books I just don't finish because I become bored. Paula Hawkins wrote this book so nicely, allowing for the reader to be in the shoes of all of the characters in different times becoming so engrossed in the story. Great read, and if you figure out what's going to happen at the end you might want to go into CSI work!!",book

3573,"In true mystery/suspense form, the tale unfolds bit by bit, giving you just enough to guess at who the murderer is. None of the characters are simple and flat; that's the bit that really makes for compelling reading. If you've dealt with drug addicts or alcoholics, then Rachel's bizarre choices make sense. Plus, she's relatable because who hasn't done people-watching and made up their stories? The fixation/obsession part eventually makes more and more sense. Not one character is 100% evil or courageous or even lost, just like real people. This is a very good novel that reads ""real.""",book

She playfully names them Jess and Jason and creates their own perfect fantasy marriage.  But one day, the lady of the house is nowhere to be seen.  Rachel suspects foul play.  She confronts the police and nearby neighbors.  There's one huge catch: Rachel has a drinking problem.  She's an unreliable witness, and has an ugly past with the neighborhood.  If she keeps prying, Rachel could become the next headline.  Written from the perspective of Rachel, Anna and Megan, Hawkins displays her Train ladies as journal entries, taken in morning and evening segments.  Will anyone ever believe Rachel, especially the fateful night she can't quite remember?  Is Anna really the sweet, caring, overprotective mom?  And what about Megan, the missing artist with the twisted past?  Hitchcock in its styling, with enough red herrings to open an aquarium, and a tarnished heroine the reader can root for, The Girl On The Train is well worth the ticket. I can't wait for the movie!",book

The heroine was  not some little perfect beauty with vanity/dating issues, who somehow has expert detective skills which helps the attractive bachelor detective in the solving of a murder case. The perfect couple then somehow falls in love as they dodge bullets and plan the perfect garden wedding only weeks after landing their perps and dissolving a crime ring. No, this was totally different, and I loved it. It was steady paced and a  screen swiper( instead of a page turner).",book

One woman watches the back yards of the houses as she rides the train and dreams stories of the residents that live in the homes.  Two remaining women who live in these houses next to the train tracks live their own lives within their own fantasies.The story is one of the most compelling I have read since "" Big Little Lies"" which is told in a similar fashion.",book

Interesting development of storyline through the perspective of the three women. I am grateful a friend told me to pay attention to which woman I was reading and the dates. Advise kept me from getting confused between them. All in all it was enjoyable, but did not live up to the hype.",book
4082,"On the positive side, I was able to read through clear to the end despite the story not being nearly as compelling as I expected.  None of the characters were particularly likeable and it's hard to get deeply involved in a story if it doesn't have at least one person you can really care about. The book had some good moments but overall it just seemed like a lot of effort for very little payoff.",book
3363,This psychological thriller is a page turner! The author does a great job developing all the characters with depth. Pay attention to the dates. All the characters are flawed and multifaceted which  makes any of them a suspect in this murder mystery!  Can't wait to see the movie!,book
4029,This book kept my attention from start to finish. The writing was so vivid that I felt my pulse quickening as I read. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys suspense and psychological thrillers.,book
2359,I enjoyed this book very much. The story has a slow buildup but the suspense was just enough to not be boring. Kept me guessing about what was going on.

The book is a litle contrived by using unreliable point of narration in a rather obvious way. It is nevertheless worth the read",book
702,"Thin, repetitive storyline. We've heard this plot before -- but never as poorly executed. The characters, dialogue and premise is a huge cliche. It's sort of like a British Desperate Housewives of classless losers on Blenheim Road -- except the TV show, Desperate Housewives, was inventive, clever and entertaining in its tongue-in-cheek comedy/drama/mystery. Here, everyone on Blenheim Road has a secret ugly scheme.The characters are one dimensional, boring and any reveals are trite and telegraphed long before you read them. Despite the fact that Rachel and Anna constantly and intensely clash throughout the entire book, here's a revelation that Rachel has in the last quarter of the book: ""Something's not right and I can't shake the feeling that it has to with Anna.""  Really? Ya think?? How did this book get so many thousands of 4 & 5-star reviews?? Something's not right -- for sure.",book

Two other ladies read this book with me and all three of us have the same consensus that this book was a waste of time and totally boring.",book
1794,"This Girl on the Train was a bit confusing at first because the story is being told through the eyes of three different characters: Rachel, Megan and Anna so the story seemed disorganized at first.

The plot was also really good and the ending intriguing right up until the very end! All in all, I definitely recommend this book!",book
62,"The Girl on the Train is like no other book I have ever read before. Typically I read historical fiction and contemporary romance so this book isn't usually what I would buy but I had heard it was impossible to put down. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the novel even though it was creepy and I felt that nothing quite added up. Something always felt a bit off. The novel had me at the edge of my seat and I finished the second half of the book in one day. I really had a hard time putting it down because the author has a way with storytelling where she ends the chapter with a cliffhanger and I just had to know what happened next. The book switches back and forth between the female narrators and the dates when certain events took place so it was sometimes a bit difficult to follow in the beginning and keep track of where everyone was on the same date but after awhile the dates got closer together and everything came together. The ending was a big surprise to me and I never would've guessed it. Like I said, I don't typically read psychological thrillers but I am glad I took a chance on this one. I highly recommend this novel to everyone, regardless of your preference in literary genres.",book

I've noticed the Gillian Flynn approach to writing becoming more and more frequent and popular.  I call it the ""dare to write a book about despicable characters"" genre.  This book is no different...not one likable, believable character in the entire book...only dipsomaniacs, egomaniacs, sociopaths, narcissists and everything in between.

It didn't quench my thirst on how the characters were left off. It just left you hanging, hoping for more but sadly nlothing else will come.

1133,"I was compelled to keep reading this book. It didn't matter that it was the last weekend of summer vacation and I was camping with my family.  Family fun?  Yeah, let me know how that goes.  I devoured this book in two sittings.  It would have been only one sitting but a girl's gotta sleep sometime.  I. Could. Not. Put. It. Down.  I found myself thinking ""Rachel is such a dysfunctional freak!"" over and over.  And that's the technical term:  dysfunctional freak.  And it is that very dysfunction that kept me enthralled.  It was like watching a train wreck--I could see what was going to happen but I was powerless to stop it nor look away.  Despite being a functional, well-rounded and STABLE individual, I could find parts of myself identifying with bits and pieces of Rachel.  I also identified with Anna and Megan as well.  I found that ability to identify with these characters made me feel uncomfortable, and THAT, ladies and gentlemen, is what made this book so good.  It's been 3 days since I finished the book and several times I've wondered ""what Anna's (or Rachel or Megan) up to"" and felt that sting when realizing ""Oh yeah, those aren't real people. Damn.""  So grab a cup of coffee or put the kettle on, find a comfy place, fire up your Kindle, and be prepared for a wonderful journey with characters that will be with you forever.",book

3590,"The writing is pretty good and the story is moderately interesting.  However, it develops very slowly.  The inciting incident, or at least the reader's awareness of it, does not occur until well into the book, when it turns into a murder mystery.  And then it is all too easy for the reader to figure out who did it, without the characters or the author telling us so.  So the mystery is kind of lame.",book
3084,"Disappointed, after all the hype.  Not believable that the murdered girl should have her own chapter in which she describes her death.  The convention of alternating chapters where each of the three women describe  their lives did not amuse me.  I found it jerky and difficult to pay attention.  I only finished the novel because it was my book club's feature of the month.  Thin story and not of lasting value.  The three men were not likable.",book

I finally began reading it because I knew that I wanted to see the movie adaptation.  So very glad that I invested the time on this page-turner!  As an avid mystery and thriller fan, I live for the unique twists these novels project and this particular story did not disappoint.  Even more excited about the film!",book

For the first 15-20 pages, I had a hard time getting into it, but once I got started I couldn't stop. And I enjoyed the fact that I didn't know who killed the girl in the story until everyone else in the book did. I highly recommend this.",book

2160,"I think my high hopes for this book are the reason I wasn't a huge fan. The blurbs and reviews compare The Girl on the Train to Gone Girl and talk about the unreliable narration and surprise ending, so I was really coming up with some wild scenarios in my head. Instead, the ending was predictable and I guessed it easily.It started off fantastic. The reader gets the point of view from three characters: the main character, Rachel; Anna, the woman who stole Rachel's husband; and Megan, the focus of the crime. It was awesome getting different POV and, honestly, the more the book progressed the more I hated everyone.The book was ripe with adultery, lies and alcoholism. The ""unreliable narration"" was certainly dead-on due to Hawkins making me consider everyone as a suspect from either their inner monologue or the way they acted around others, treated others or were thought of by others. I was absorbed in their lives and how everything connected.I was pretty pissed at Rachel throughout, but I also deeply pitied her. She was a horrible alcoholic who stalked her ex-husband and his new family. She--almost creepily--made up a whole life for a couple she watched daily on her train ride (it's one thing to just make up a story; it's another to build on the story and believe the attributes you created are true). She was someone you wouldn't befriend and, if you were friends with her, you'd sever the friendship the first change you had. But, she had reasons for her drinking and actions that I could understand. I still wished she'd found better avenues to deal with her pain but I sympathized with her the more I learned.I went through the same roller coaster of emotions with Anna and Megan. Anna I felt bad for because her husband's ex-wife was constantly coming around, two years after their divorce, but Anna was the cause of their divorce (or at least the final reason for Tom to sign the papers), so I also felt a bit like it was karma. Megan I couldn't figure out, then I was pissed at her, then she reveals something huge and I felt so, so bad for her and couldn't even imagine what I'd have done in her shoes.Hawkins was great at confusing my feelings and keeping me on edge to find out how it would end. Then, the ending came and it was lackluster. Yes, revelations happened and I suppose the very end could have come as a surprise, but the ""who-done-it"" was almost obvious. It could be Hawkins gave a little too much away in hints towards the end; it could be my expectations were set too high; or it could be that the ending was similar to many other books and I was expecting/hoping for something more jaw-dropping and original. Whatever the reason, I wasn't impressed.I still recommend the book--the writing is fantastic and Hawkins created complex characters who were completely flushed out. Just, if you've read Gone Girl, don't expect an ending in any way similar to that. Otherwise, I think you'll enjoy the read.",book
4144,"Written kind of in a strange way, but once you get past that, it's a page-turner. I guessed the ""plot twist"" almost halfway through so it was fun to discover that I was right. Ending was slightly disappointing",book
4872,"It was an interesting read, but I am not a fan of novels narrated by alternating characters and alternating time periods.

4132,Very engaging story.  I couldn't put it down.  Every new page presents you with a new idea of what really happened.  I enjoyed the fact that at times you weren't really sure whether the narrator was really reliable or not- it added another whole mysterious level to the tale.,book

The plot is good even though I did find out very soon who the murder was, but  they way the book is written is genius, having the points of view from three persons is brilliant.",book
1777,"This was a mesmerizing read. Each plot twist and development compelled me to read more of the book. The story conjured echoes of Gillian Flynn's ""Gone Girl,"" but they are distinctly different works. Rachel is a confounding narrator, and equally infuriating character. Her personal flaws and repeated misinterpretations of other characters' intentions are key to the novel. If you can't accept Rachel, you probably won't enjoy the story. The chapters told from the other characters' perspectives enriched the storytelling and mystery. An entertaining, escapist read.",book

1012,"The Girl on the Train is entertaining but if you know an alcoholic it is almost theraputic.  I do, I was married to one, and it was as if my ex was the subject of the story.  The author characterizes the excuses, the shift of accountability, the self absorbed personality perfectly and makes what to some may be an unlikely story very real to those who have lived with one.  There are some plot twists and other than the alcoholic implications the theme is that nothing is really as it seems.  I avoided this book for months, seeing it in the best seller list, but finally decided to give it a shot.  I enjoyed it.",book
63,"I really enjoyed the way the tale is told from the perspective of the three women. It held my attention while tempting me, consistently, to ponder the next turn and unfold the connections and clues that take the reader round the next corner of the story. After finishing the book I rented the movie and found it to be an awful interpretation.",book
1721,"A rare treasure, written with verve and suspense, impossible to put down, and yet it needs perspective, standing back from it, contemplating the nuances, the self-absorption, the narcisistic nature of alcoholism.  Narcisists don't have to be beautiful, they don't necessarily revel in their self-esteem.  Quite the contrary, underneath it all they fear they are not beautiful and their self-esteem is absent or damaged, but they are absorbed in their own reflection, content, in fact surreptitiously delighted to subject those around them to their compulsions.  Yet Hawkins has turned it all into a mystery thriller.  Her recourse for the character's catharsis is chilling.  Are all women masochists?  And do they love the sociopath in compelling men?  This book is exceptional, far more than just a ""good read"", despite the occasional and very minor slips in syntax.",book
718,"I'm actually surprised that this book is as popular as it is, when there are so many good ones out there right now.  I've seen this book compared to Gone Girl, and I don't understand because while it has a similar premise, (missing girl, murder, intrigue) it was entirely less interesting and surprising, although I will admit that The Girl on the Train did keep me in suspense for the first half.  It seemed like the author had a great idea with a girl on a train, studying people's lives as she passed by, but then it got muddled by a bunch of affairs and entirely too attractive people.Ultimately I was rooting for this book to be better, but the characters were not relatable or realistic in my opinion, and it seemed like I was watching a soap opera.",book
2667,"It was a good read, however I certainly wouldn't rate it among the best.; I'm somewhat surprised it hit the best seller list.  The characters struggle with emotional challenges complicated by alcohol and stress with the backdrop of a sudden murder.  As the title suggests, much of the action and assumptions are made from the main character perspective (what she thinks, fantasizes and witnesses from the train window). From my perspective the ending was very predictable.",book
2692,"If you're looking for an easy, enjoyable read without too much depth, this book is for you.A decent novel by anyone's standards. Well written with the right amount of humor and wit. (British humor and language is always something I enjoy -- a break from the norm.)However, I don't see what all the rave is about. It's another Gone Girl in style and plot. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely a page turner and I often found myself wanting to get back to reading as soon as possible. But, in the end, I just did not love this book.I guess with all the hype about how great of a novel this was, I got my hopes up. High expectations and average quality make for a semi-letdown reader.",book

423,"The Girl on the Train had my attention at times, other times I felt like I was just trying to get to the end. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced, jobless, alcoholic. She shows up at her old house (which is now being lived in by her ex, his new wife and their daughter) and doesn't remember it the next day as she suffers from alcoholic amnesia. She makes up a pretend life for the people that live a few doors down from her old house as she passes them by everyday as she pretends to go to work. She then learns the woman in said house is now missing. She was in the area that night but cannot remember anything because of a blackout. The story then goes on with Rachel trying to fill in the missing pieces that night.This story is told from three different pov. We have Rachel, the amnesiac alcoholic, Anne, the mistress and now wife of Rachel's ex, and Megan, the now missing woman with a lot of secrets. Most of the characters in this book are rather bleak. The only one I found likeable was Rachel's roomate. I think she may be the only sane one in the bunch. This book could be redundant at times with Rachel always drinking but never remember what happened. But she somehow found her way home each time.I give it three stars because it was an okay read. I probably wouldn't recommend it to my friends but if you can't find anything to read this book can pass the time.",book
2604,My friends raved about this book and I couldn't wait to read it. I think their accolades were overly enthusiastic. The three main characters were so whiney. Each one wallowed in self-pity. I enjoy reading mysteries and I like authors who can build the suspense until the last few days. This book held no surprises and I was able to figure out the villain before the book was half over.  Most readers will not agree with my assessment of Hawkins book but I doubt I will read another of her novels.,book
570,Very thought provocative.,book
3372,"Page turner...I could not put it down!  Kept me guessing and intrigued to the very end.  I love flawed characters with a bit of ""the twisted"" in them.  I have recommended this one to all my avid reader friends.  The title character is, in some respects, just a pitiful mess.  Not exactly someone you want to care about, but keep on with because it is like watching a train wreck (no pun intended)...you just can't look away.  With few redeeming qualities, she sets herself on a trajectory of a constant downward spiral and yet there is something about her that makes you believe she is worthy of being redeemed.  I won't give away plot details - you can read those anywhere.  I will just say that once on board, you will want to ride to the end of this intriguing read.",book
2096,"2.5 stars. The women in the book--Anna, Megan and Rachel--are not likable. I did not feel drawn in to find out what happened next. The premise was okay in that someone riding a train daily past the same houses might make up some story about the people living there to while away their daily commute. However, the interconnections of implausibly self-absorbed, ill or evil people just did not appeal to me. Nor did the author's technique of switching voices between the women and moving about the timeline of their parts. I am guessing that was to add suspense but it just annoyed me and I found myself caring so little about trying to figure out which month, year and person was talking that I skipped to the end. I was hoping that the ending might change my overall opinion...but I was wrong. Yes, it was dark and suspenseful at times but not something I will recommend.",book
2103,"This book was very thought provoking. I did it in a book club and it did not disappoint.  The struggle between mental abuse, addiction and memory loss made for great thoughts to ponder.  We all watch people around us, does that make us crazy?  People may recall details of a situation differently. But when someone goes missing everything/ everyone is called into question.",book
1330,"It is not the kind of book that you would want to make time to read it; rather it is good entertainment while you are commuting, waiting in the It line, or having nothing else to do.I have mostly read the book on the train - probably better this way in the first place. Five minutes now and then make me more emotionally and sympathetic connected to the main characters. But I feel a bit uncomfortable that is a book of how two women fell, stupidly and desperately for a bad, smart guy. I will be looking forward to a book that's the other way round - stupid boys fell in love with dangerous, smart and bad girls.Sorry that I am a lousy reviewer, but anyway - the book is good to kill your time, but don't get your hopes up.",book
1970,"Marketed as being like Gone Girl, which is a tough act to follow for any author, but this is not even in the same league. It is a story as tawdry as any tabloid grief porn and the characters are unsympathetic. I feel sullied for having read it.",book
186,"I hated the book. How much? Well, this book pissed me off because I just couldn't finish the damn thing. I read about 45% of it and put it down for a few weeks hoping I could start it fresh and become more engaged in the story than I was during the first half. I was irritated because I have rarely walked away from even the most boring, tedious tale.I'm a reader, 60, educated and a male. This doesn't put me in the target audience. But I could have enjoyed the ride if it just moved along a little or if ALL the characters weren't petty, self absorbed basket cases. Their responses to what befalls them each individually seems trite and/or illogical to a fault. I wanted to throw the Kindle across the room as Rachel stumbles along on what is either a quest to solve a mystery or a road to redemption. That was about 70% of the way through the book. But the straw that broke the camel's back came when I realized that we're getting narration of past events from a character whom, by all rights, shouldn't be able to do that. And that's as close to a spoiler as I'm willing to get.Obviously I'm in a minority group of dissenters here and granted. For the folks that love this story, more power to you, your money was well invested. Also, I'll grant the writer due credit for skill in structure and character development but I found the whole thing boring, boring and a snooze. I had no sympathy or empathy for a single character in this book. Nasty, nasty people with nary a redeeming quality between them. If they were at least interesting...",book
3009,"One of the best ways to build suspense and keep the reader wondering who the killer might be is through the device of the unreliable narrator.

Somehow these narrators are sympathetic, too.",book
2847,"Fantastic book. Characters are well developed and it's written in such a way that you can almost feel what they're feeling. I saw the movie and was disappointed in the director's take. I recommend the book BEFORE you see the movie. It's a really great, spellbinding read.",book
2179,"The stylistic writing riveted while introducing us to the deep point of view of the flawed protagonist and building to a satisfying climax.

1873,"This is a tough book to review, because I cannot honestly say that I disliked it. I liked it. Begrudgingly, I liked it. It was a quick and easy read. I switched back and forth between the Kindle and Audible versions and though I liked the acting in the audiobook, I found myself just wanting to read because I could do so quicker than listening.This book reminded me a lot of Gone Girl--seemingly complex characters that somehow seem completely base when you get to know them. There is no one to like or root for, which is frustrating, and you are not sure who to trust because there are multiple narrators. Everything leads up to a reveal, which I believe most readers will be able to figure out about halfway through the book, and then the story just ends.Unlike Gone Girl, I believe it was mildly well-written, capturing voice especially well. I also did not feel as if my time was wasted because it was such a fast read, and I did find myself thinking about the stories when I wasn't reading. I gave it three stars because emotionally, I let myself get involved, and any less stars would have been dishonest (but oh how I longed to give it only two!).This is a good beach or vacation read, something to excite you during the mundane winter months or pass the time on a long trip. It is not a life-changing journey, nor is it something that will leave you feeling as if you learned something, but it will certainly keep you guessing.",book

It is just somewhat a contorted story seemingly just because.",book
946,"This was for book club and we were all in agreement - utterly forgettable beach read. As this book was compared to Gone Girl and Rear Window we went in with high hopes. Unfortunately, you have three unsympathetic, unlikeable women who are unreliable narrators with similar voices, and the two-dimensional dysfunctional men in their lives. I figured out the murderer about two-thirds of the way into the book. The ending is nothing short of unbelievable. The one thing the author does get right is that alcohol-driven black outs are not caused by the failure to remember, but the brain�s failure to transfer events from short term to long term memory. She then discards this fact when her plot�s stuck and she needs Rachel to remember something in order to end the story. A very disappointing read.",book
1801,"I think I'm one of the few who wasn't impressed. To have each chapter told from someone else's POV, each character needs to have a different ""voice"". All of the females in this story sound the same. You really had to make sure you knew exactly who's mind you were in at all time or you will be confused. Also, all of the characters had very generic names that made it very hard to distinguish who was who.With such great reviews and having not heard one bad thing, I was disappointed. Good intriguing story but generic characters.",book

I thought she could have ended the novel a little better, but the character development was phenomenal.  One good thing, there weren't any holes in the story, and I felt like she explained everything that needed to be answered.

119,"Whenever each of us reads a book, consciously - or unconsciously -  our reactions to the story, the characters, the writing  all affected by what we  to the story. My own reading experience was quite disturbing, so much so that the psychological, emotional abuse of my past marriage was triggered in ways that stunned and frightened me.  Proust was either lucky or fanciful with the charming memories triggered by his famous madeleine cookies.  This novel is suspenseful and fast paced.  It is also a subtle and complex story about women -  women's experiences and desires within the context of Western culture: how women live with men - or ,in this story, a man - about how we come to believe ""truths"" about ourselves.  The story can be read in many ways: suspenseful murder mystery; fast paced psychological mystery; and also as a story about a complex main character -  weak  and unlikeable when first introduced - and her relationships within the other women's stories.  As this tale is unwoven by the author, we find the main character caught up in a plausible tale about the fallout from lies and the (too often invisible) psychological and emotional abuse women endure silently, frequently without self-awareness, leaving these characters with few skills to ""see"" the truth.

200,"The Girl on the Train is a perfect primer for women who still believe the man they fall in love with is responsible for their happily ever after. The story is narrated by three women--Rachel, wife #1, Anna, wife # 2, and Megan, the new prospect. All are involved with one man, Tom, in an overlapping sequence of events. It so happens that Tom is perfect for all three of the women at the beginning of each relationship because he is masterful at giving each what they need. Therefore, each woman fails to see that Tom becomes manipulative and controlling. But as each relationship falters, all three women expect Tom to make it better. Unfortunately for them, Tom's idea of improving a bad relationship is to move on to a new one--which becomes a problem that hits Tom squarely when Megan, the new woman he is involved with, decides to no longer be manipulated. When she threatens to take control from him, life as each woman knew it spirals out of control.This novel is a worthy read because it shows how easy it is for some women to willingly give up control of their happiness to the man who promises them love forever. In the case of the women in this story, their unhappiness involves so much whining and drinking that it's hard to like any of them. However, Rachel does redeem herself when she starts to realize Tom has manipulated her to a level that shows he is dangerous and capable of much worse. Tom is the anatomy of a perfect psychopath, and the author leaves enough unsaid about Tom until the reader puts it all together. This book is a must for women who still believe in the fairy tale prince!",book
3673,"Loved it! The beginning was very dark but soon weaved into a super suspenseful read - some mysteries have so many seemingly unrelated details that have to come together that you  reread previous pages- this was just the right mix of mystery, without being too complicated.  Can't  wait for the movie-",book
3400,Very well written. Similar in feeling to Gone Girl as I was reading it.,book
1746,"We chose to read this for our book club, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. On one hand, it brought me back to a time when people took the time to relax, riding a train for everyday travel. The author sucked me in right away with her description of characters and events, enabling me to feel as though I were actually there. The emotions were real, and twists in the story felt normal, not contrived. As I rode the train into NYC one day, I channelled the protagonist, and watched as houses flew by, and thinking what stories they may contain.",book
3180,"I've been up until midnight the last two nights finishing this book. Once I got past the halfway point, I couldn't put it down! I loved the character build-up, and the plot kept me guessing and made me feel like anything was possible. In the end, the surprises kept coming until almost the last page. There were about 5 different times throughout the book that I was convinced I'd figured it all out, only to be thrown another curve again and again. Highly recommend this book (unless you enjoy getting to sleep at a decent hour...in that case, save this one for vacation or a weekend). Great read.",book
339,"This is not a good book. The ""twist"" was obvious early on and not much of a surprise. What is with these female novelists who write these absolutely pitiful female characters who are so dependent on a man and popping out babies to give them social status that they are utterly broken and inoperable without these things. BOO!",book
1915,Thought I was going to love this book! It was so popular and I saw so many people reading it. I waited a bit before reading it because I wanted the perfect beach book. So disappointed. Confusing layout of chapters going between characters and timelines. Confusing storyline with back & forth character side stories. I'll wait until this author writes a second book & give her another chance.,book
3772,The book captured my attention for the first 35 pages but then I got bored with the characters and how they kept making stupid mistakes with their lives. I did a lot of skimming to finish the book. Do not recommend this book and probably won't bother seeing the movie.,book
2003,"The story is complex and well thought out. I really enjoyed this book even though I'm not super into mysteries.The idea of a main character so flawed and dysfunctional that she seems like a hopeless person is actually pretty cool. You're reading about this utterly pathetic woman stumbling around and you're thinking, ""ok, how can a book be about a person like this?"" So then that becomes intriguing, and you keep reading to find out how she got into that state whether she'll manage to pull herself together.",book
2218,"It's uncommon to associate the word beautiful with a thriller but that's the fitting description for this book. Every character has a story that's carefully crafted and wound together, the suspense is nail-bitingly built up; not stretched unnecessarily or over dramatised. Every scene can be vividly imagined. The end is predictable after a certain point, but sends a chill down your spine nevertheless. Definitely worth a read!",book
1279,"Memo to all those of you who are healthcare workers who work a 7 on 7 off shift.  I thought I could read this on my breaks at work and maybe an hour at home,  I was wrong,  I could not put this book down and at 1 point contemplated calling in sick.  I didn't but I finished it and loved it.  So begin on your week off.  Don't worry about finishing it- you will have it done in the next two days.  I suppose like Gone Girl it has characters that are not very like able .  But the characters draw you in slowly and you reach a certain acceptance/understanding.  Great story and I recommend it highly!",book

2213,"What's with the ""GIRL"" books? Dragon Tattoos...Gone, etc. This book is just a rehash of Gone Girl, with two people telling their stories. I read it all and it was interesting, but not best seller material in my opinion. And this is all reviews are..an opinion. Would I recommend it to a friend? Sure, why not? A good read. To suggest an exceptional read, however, I would recommend The Circle, by Dave Eggers.",book
4438,"It started out as what I might have considered ""hard to read"" but then got very interesting real quick.  I couldn't put it down.  I was so hooked.  I'm excited to see the movie.  With a suspense, maybe it can live up to the book.  :)",book
319,"I was so excited for this book, and I am so genuinely disappointed. There was nothing original or ""thriller"" about it plot-wise, the main character is highly unlikeable (there are no redeeming or even EXCITING or INTERESTING qualities about ANY of the characters, but the main one is just an unlikeable, bland, boring person), and the whole book is really very boring until the last 15 or so pages, and the action that fills those pages is VERY predictable. There's no plot twist, there's no hero or heroine, there's little to no character arc/development. The only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping for that spark or twist or something that people kept raving about. I would give it 1 star, but I feel that it does have potential to be a good movie if done correctly; I'll be seeing it.",book
2771,"I had to listen to this after reading so many reviews. I can't say I loved the book. It left me with the same heavy feelings as ""Gone Girl"" and in my opinion it was this years equivalent.

2152,"I really enjoyed this book. The narrator is totally unreliable which keeps you guessing and trying to figure out her real story.  You know the whole time you're reading it that there must be something more to what you know so far.  Keep reading, it's a good one!",book
885,"<<possible spoiler-ish info, so use caution>>Paula Hawkins' debut novel hooks you pretty quickly.Rachel Watson takes the same train to and from her suburban London home every day. She has grown accustomed to the people on the train, and the things the train passes along its route, especially a set of houses set back from the tracks. Most days the train stops at a signal which allows her to observe the people in those houses, and she imagines they are living happier lives than she is. She often sees one attractive couple, whom she's named Jason and Jess, and she's invented careers for them, and feels so good about their relationship.One day, what she sees from her seat on the train shocks her. ""Jess"" is kissing another man! How could she jeopardize the perfect relationship that she and ""Jason"" have? Rachel is devastated and angry, since her own life is in a shambles, and she has idealized this couple she doesn't know. And when ""Jess,"" whose real name is Megan, disappears the next day, Rachel is shocked�and feels that she needs to tell the police what she saw. Little by little, she gets more involved in the investigation about what happened to Megan, because she wants to do her part, and she feels that she knows something.The thing is, though, Rachel isn't entirely reliable. She has a bit of a drinking problem�well, a big drinking problem. And sometimes she has trouble remembering what happens when she drinks. But she has this feeling she might have seen what happened to Megan. If only she could remember...""I have lost control over everything, even the places in my head.""The Girl on the Train is the story of a woman who feels as if life has tossed her out, and she cannot regain her momentum. She is desperate to feel needed, to feel wanted, included again, so when she sees an opportunity to try and help out with the investigation into Megan's disappearance she jumps at the chance. But she doesn't count on her own lies and inadequacies being revealed, or being forced to confront her own issues.Hawkins is a terrific writer and has written a taut, compelling book, despite the fact that many of its characters are pretty unlikeable. The book is told from multiple perspectives�Rachel, Megan, and Anna, Rachel's ex-husband's new wife. I found my mind spinning with all of the different possibilities of what happened, and what was going to happen. I came up with outlandish theories, theories that seemed they had merit, and one I hoped wouldn't be the case.Then sadly, in my mind, Hawkins punted. She took the easy way out, and it honestly killed the book for me. I don't think I'm smarter than many people, although I guess I read a lot of thrillers, but I totally saw the ending coming. I was truly disappointed.I'd definitely encourage you to read this book and formulate your own opinions. So many people have absolutely loved it in its entirety, and been shocked by the way everything transpires, so perhaps you will as well. I think for the most part, this is a pretty great book, and I look forward to seeing what comes next in Hawkins' career.",book
356,"I can't decide if I really liked this book or not. I kept reading just to find out the who and why, but found it hard to like any of the people.",book
4206,"I was hoping for another Gone Girl, while the story wasn't awful I just hate that style of the set up , each chapter anothrr person, flipping back the dates.  A better story allows that style, but I was just annoyed thru most of the reading.",book
1767,"I had been hearing about this one for a long time and then I heard they were making a movie. So I decided it was time to buy it and read it. I devoured this book in a few short days. I loved how the story was from a few different points of view, so we could get inside the head of these characters. The story focuses on Rachel, the girl on the train. She takes the same route each day and there is a couple she sees as she is riding by, but one day something is different. I loved this story and I loved how Paula made you think about it and made you think it was everyone. This was a great psychological thriller, highly recommended!",book
188,"I wish I liked this one more. It is an interesting concept with the alternating chapters between characters, the vague narration, the mystery of a woman's disappearance, the train travel. But for me the good parts did not outweigh the boring or less than stellar parts.My feelings in short: Engaging beginning, boring middle, exciting ending.My main problems were:1. Writing style. It was waaaaaaay too much internal dialogue. Some is totally okay. We all think in our heads or talk to ourselves. But I hate excessive internal dialogue, and in the case of this story it was a lot. So for me, this was a major issue. Now, if you like internal dialogue, you may very well love this book. But I personally need more character interactions; more showing, less telling, please.2. Characters. I also didn't like any of these characters, except for Rachel's roommate (who was dismissed for being nice). Rachel, Anna, and Megan are the narrators, and I found my interest in them waning. Having an alcoholic for a main narrator was interesting to start, then super annoying. Tom and Scott were no better. These people all had issues galore, which usually makes for an intriguing read. But unfortunately, even with their issues, I lost my interest in them.3. Repetitive. I was pretty engaged in the first 30% or so. Basically until I figured out the twist. Then I was waiting for the characters to catch up with me. Then I was bored. It was lie, get drunk, blackout; rinse and repeat. Once I knew what was coming (maybe not the details, but the main idea), I felt like maybe 100 pages of the book could have been removed due to sheer repetitiveness, and it would have been fine with me. Living in an alcoholic haze with Rachel became tedious. The saving grace was the ending. At least it left me on a high note.On the positive side, I read this book for my book club, and I was in the minority on my feelings toward it. The other women either liked or loved it. So this book got a 5/6 approval rating from us. No one else in my book club figured out the twist, either, so they were far more engaged than I was. Perhaps if I hadn't figured out the twist at 30% I would have liked it more, too. Oh well.Would I recommend this book? Sure. If you like a book with mystery and odd characters, and don't mind a lot of internal dialogue, this might just be the book for you.",book
1697,"Pretty good read, but I expected better after reading and hearing the hype about this book. I had figured out most of the ""who done it"" fairly early on. A bit dark for my taste, especially with the alcoholic problems the main character has, but that is probably intended. Set in London, it was interesting to read some of the descriptions of different areas of the city and the commute many people who work there experience.  All in all a good mystery with a surprise finish.  I gave it 3 stars; would have given it 3 1/2 if possible.",book
4042,"The first half of the book was overkill with the drinking problem,seemingly mental problems and self pity. Itt became tiresome. It wasn't until 50% of the way through that it became more interesting and I decided to hang in there to find out the ending.",book
4962,"Ok, don't think you can read it a little bit at a time. It needs to be read about an hour at a time. I kept falling asleep reading it, but that could just be me, because, honestly, I loved the book. I wish I had spent less time trying to figure it all out and just read the dang story for what it is....sigh....too much of a psy. major still in my head I suppose.",book
283,excellent story. Figured out the end about 80% through but still a very exciting ending. Really worth the read. Once you're into it a real page turner. Great read for both men and women.,book
3734,It was a quick read that kept your interest to a point but there are absolutely no endearing characters in the book.  Every person in the story has issues.  There is not one character to route for.  They are a cast of characters with no morals.  Unlike a thriller like Gone Girl where you could get behind someone this just didn't do it for me. Just bad people doing bad things to each other.,book
1075,"My sister and I loved the audible version of this book. We listened to it while on a road trip and had trouble shutting it off when we got to a destination.  It is so well written, great character development and always keep us guessing.  The narrator is also excellent.  I highly recommend this book - in print or narrative form.",book
882,I started reading this book a few years back and I left it on the 3 or 4th chapter. When I saw that they made a movie of it. I decided to give it another try. I immediately remembered why I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. I wanted to unveil the secret and get to the bottom of everything. The book leads you one way and then it takes you another. Buy what I found most profound is the description of alcoholism and what people really go through. I really felt dizzy and frustrated and angry and Rachel at times. It was a very good book and I can't wait for the movie!,book
1960,"The title was about something I would do on my commute to work, but her detail about the people who lived on Blenheim Road were regular people with ordinary lives but built these characters to be flawless with perfect families until you find out that they weren't so perfect.

1071,"I must admit that I was not a fan at the beginning. The book started off rather slow for me. However, I'm that person that when I start something I have to finish. The book doesn't have chapter numbers so I can't really tell you when the change happened for me, but I'm glad I stayed with it. Really good read. I gave four stars for the slow beginning.",book
1197,This was a really excellent book. I could barely put it down. The author did an excellent job of writing the characters' feelings and thoughts in a way where I easily identified with them and was able to feel their perspective like it was my own. Definitely a must read.,book
1740,"it was an okay read for me. I figured out who did it before I was halfway through the book and that completely ruined it for me. I don't regret buying it but all the hype was just that... hype! If you are an avid mystery reader, it won't hold up. I say read it anyway and make up your own mind. I won't read it again.",book

2132,"It took me a little while to 'get into' the book but something about it kept pulling me back after I put it down.  I usually don't care much for stories that bounce back and forth between characters, but there's something about this one that kept me hooked.  I wanted to know more about the characters and where their stories were going.  I also found it a bit disturbing; perhaps because it shows the darkness that hides in all of us everyday people  but I would definitely recommend it to another reader.",book
3969,"I was in a reading rut and needed something to re-ignite the flame. I had heard a lot of positive comments on the book and had people give me personal recommendations for it. In my opinion, the boom started a little slow. But once the action started I couldn't put the book down!",book
2125,Very predictable. Tried to like it and hoped I was wrong as I had it figured out by about a quarter of the way through. Extremely disappointed to find that reading all the way to the end netted me nothing except confirmation of my theory. I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't read it; astute readers will be able to put two and two together and figure it out like I did prior to the end and will probably be disappointed with it like I was.,book
1320,I finally read this to see what all the fuss was about.  I went in with high expectations and that probably played a part in my disappointment.  I found this to be a boring read.  The girl kept getting drunk and then racking her brain to try and remember what she did while inebriated.  Not the kind of suspense I find exciting.,book
4312,"I really loved how the narrator changed throughout the book, it took me awhile to really get into the story but once I did it was the kind of book you can't wait to get home and pick up again.  The author did a great job NOT doing a lot of foreshadowing so the ending came as somewhat of a surprise and that made it more fun to make my own predictions along the way.Don't expect this to read as well as a Gillian Flynn thriller, it took awhile for the story to really get rolling.  Definitely a good read, but compared to other books I've read in the same genre recently I gave it 4 stars.",book
1457,This book is ok.  I believe there was a lot more hype to it then need be.  I felt like I knew ALL about the characters drinking problem and when the build up finally came at the end it was the last 90% of the book.  So the other 80% wasn't worth it..  I read a lot of books and I felt this one wasn't on  a top 10 list for me.  It didn't hold my interest and I actually wanted to stop reading it after a while..,book

A total and absolute waste of money and time.",book

154,"I'm not sure how many stars to give this book.  It is ""very British"" meaning not an American voice, references that resonate with UK citizens made me look up words.Perhaps the fact that I am American, pragmatically American, I did not connect with any of the characters. Not even the baby was described in a way that made me smile; whining, grizzing, no cooing or cuddles really.The characters are self involved and yet not evolved as human beings, which, I suppose is usually the case.The mystery is very good.  It is a true twisting tale of human craziness.  Maybe like the classic Of Human Bondage.Upon reading the last page, I felt sad, not hopeful. I don't think that the character arc was complete but as this is a mystery,perhaps it is keeping in its kind.The other thing that I thought was,""this author is messed up."". But I am middle aged, not raised in the cable tv extremes that millennials, etc have been inured to since birth.  The way that it s written is new, the myriads of relationships:ancient.This book is timeless and brutal, perhaps in the end, there is hope.",book
5,"I'm an editor by trade, so I found the numerous run-ons a bit distracting. I also had trouble keeping track of the story when the chapters jumped back-and-forth in time; it's very easy (and a bit disorienting) to end up halfway through a chapter before realizing that scene isn't a continuation of the previous chapter, but a completely different incident taking place in the past. Girl on the Train also left too many loose ends for my liking: for example, who is the red-haired man and why was he so important to include into the story if he doesn't do anything other than show up at inopportune times and (sort of) hit on the main character?I have to wonder if the author has personal experience with alcoholism, because the way she depicted the main character's thought process was very much in line with what I've seen from recovering addicts. That part is very effectively written; at the same time, it does make the main character harder to relate to, especially if you've never experienced it.Overall, it's not a terrible book, but I don't get the hype over it. As my book club friend described it, Girl on the Train is an airplane book: fine for killing a couple hours when you're traveling and have nothing better to do.",book
2979,"This is one of those books that you have to read fast because you're hoping the end is better than the rest of the book.There are no poetic sentences, no great descriptions, no interesting characters, no sublime dialogue, just a horrible paranoid feeling of sadness, vindictiveness, and dread from the three women who inhabit the book.Somehow, they miraculously changed their demeanor at the end and became heroines.",book

2284,The main characters are immature and self-serving people without much regard or consideration for their actions.  I thought this novel was just another story about over-sexed individuals and alcoholics who make stupid decisions and mess up their lives.  The writing was very well done. The movie is about to come out next week and the author has done pretty well financially for her first trashy romance-thriller.,book
1962,"There's a good reason this is coming out in movie format.  It's GREAT!  Kind of made me feel engrossed in the same way ""Gone Girl"" did.  I had to keep checking the time line to keep things straight in my head.  I'll be interested to see how the movie works with that.  Let your imagination take you through the visuals your mind creates before watching Emily Blunt create a whole different picture.  I'm sure the buzz about the movie is right and this will be a winner.  How could it not be with that woman acting the starring role in a story this dark?",book

Movie is very good, too, and makes only a few changes.",book

2490,"Ms Hawkins has a problem here, but one that the publishers are happy to exploit - Gone Girl.There were always going to be comparisons, but the marketing opportunity was enormous, and it was taken advantage of. In fact, one has to wonder, ""What was the original title of the manuscript?""Standing on its own feet, it's not a bad read. Not the page turner various reviews had me expecting, it plodded along in sections, and wasn't helped by the stilted writing. Trains trundle more than once, sunlight is burnished, knuckles white on wheels... we've all read it more than once.  Given the structure, more adept character development was called for, along with stronger, more distinct voices. It was difficult to invest too much in the main character, and the men came across more as projections than flesh and blood.Having said all that, it would make for a decent read on the train to and from work.Probably safer than looking out the window, in Ms Hawkins' world.",book
2889,"I know that train and have had the experience of imagining the lives of people in their sectioned off home, people who were oblivious to me, so I felt myself riding on the train with her.

The only thing sloppier than the protagonist was the writing. I feel the character blacked out whenever the author couldn't think of what to write. Instead of weaving hints and subtleties throughout the book about the antagonist to keep you guessing and wondering, the author just decided her protagonatist got tanked (again) and she wouldn't write about the antagonist until the end then BAM you hear all about it. Lazy lazy lazy writing and a terrible way to bring in the antagonist. I never give one stars for books but I'd give this a zero if I could. Don't waste your time.",book

I watched the movie, and other then Rosemund Pike playing a psychopath amazingly, it sucked also. A friend recommended this book as the remedy. It reminds me of something one would watch on the ID Channel so it was realistic to and I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 evenings.

The train is a great metaphor for the way we experience life - just passing through or carefully observing the details of everyday living. The author does a good job of playing with your mind.

I found the first two thirds of the book slow, boring with totally unappealing women characters.  It was not until the last third of the book that it picked up in solving the murder, even if the characters, now including the men, were still ridiculous, unsympathetic and the murderer became clear way before the ending.  I only stuck it out because people I know told me how wonderful the book was.  Won't take their reading recommendations any more.",book
352,"Ugh....it took everything in me to even get to page 50, at which time I skimmed quickly to the end and wasn't impressed at all.  If you like Gone Girl then you'll like this.  I liked neither.",book

1302,When I first started reading this book I didn't think I would like it The format was a little different Three women names list for different chapters but once I got started it sure kept me interested  only a few main character probably 5 or 6 and that all the author need good read,book
4782,"Really enjoyed this book - it's the first I've read from Paula Hawkins and could not put it down. I like the way it's narrated in the first person for the various characters, so it switches throughout the book. Keeps it interesting and gives you an in-depth feel for each character.",book
934,"I found this book very difficult to get into at the start. I had to go back to the previous chapter to check dates, but once I realized what the author was doing, the story became more suspenseful. It starts with Rachel, a train commuter, imagining the life stories of the people she sees out the window of the train everyday as she passes. She is especially concerned with a couple that lives in a house in her old neighborhood. She believes their life to be perfect. But all that changes as the woman turns out to be missing and the story turns to reality. Now the author moves the story along as told by the three main characters viewing the same events from each characters point of view. It was very interesting and difficult to decide who had the correct view as each had their own previous experiences that colors their outlook and Rachel has a drinking problem with blackouts. Rachel complicates matters becoming involved in the reality mixing it with what she had imagined.Even though I had trouble getting started, I kept reading because of all the previous great reviews and was rewarded with a great and differently told mystery story.",book

1710,"I thought the book was great. It wasn't what I was expecting at all, but it was good. It was a bit difficult at first to get into the writing style, but after 20 pages or so, it was easier to read. I was able to read it pretty quickly. At some point, I had a hard time putting it down. I love books that are suspenseful and the plot has some surprises. I would definitely recommend this!",book
3873,I absolutely loved this book. I would honestly recommend it to anyone who likes a mystery. Someone who can literally just throw themselves into a book because this book is honestly one of my favorites now! It written really well and it was a definite shock.,book
3034,"I cringed throughout so much of this novel because Hawkins writes in such a way that she reveals all of our deepest shames, our bad experiences, raw human thoughts. It is also why I couldn't put this book down. Give this a read! And definitely do it before you watch the movie",book
4497,"I couldn't stand the main character Rachel.  It seemed she made every problem worse, and, she was so needy. It was interesting hearing from three women's perspective.  She made up a fantasy of the people she could see from the train in her old neighborhood. She was seen as a crank by the police. It was fascinating how she worked on her memory to piece what really happened in her life.",book
3803,"I purchased this book based on a pre-release review I read in a newsletter. It was downloaded to my Kindle on the release day and I started it soon after. The beginning was slow. It didn't hook me at all. I put it down and only came back to it a couple of weeks later when I didn't have anything else to read.I am glad I did, too. This was a good story. It has been compared to ""Gone Girl"", something I disagree with. It is better than ""Gone Girl"". At least ""The Girl On The Train"" didn't leave me feeling cheated and Rachael was a sympathetic (if somewhat messy) narrator.Stick with the book through the first twenty or so pages. You'll be glad you did.",book
3594,"The plot was weak and under developed. The characters had a name, but no dept. The story read like the author had a good idea , but she just threw the story together. The reader had no idea who the narrators were as they were introduced into the story. To add to my disappointment, they were not realistic or believable. I'm glad this was a short story, or I might not finished it. I can't believe this was on any best seller list.",book
1025,"I do not usually read thrillers. I throw that caveat out there because that's the reason for my being unable to rate this full marks. I will say that I didn't like things about the book, but I cannot decide whether they are real flaws or whether they are just my own dislikes of the genre. The book is dark, twisted and more than a page-turner. But it has a restlessness, an unequivocal torsion that makes it difficult for me to believe the behaviors of some of the character. I enjoyed reading it, even despite this seeming flaw, but it left me feeling (as many books of this ilk often do) that the trouble is not over. The restlessness, endless and unabated, will haunt for longer than I am comfortable with-requiring me to read something mindless and fluffy to dispel it quicker from my brain. If that's the real aim of the thriller genre, maybe it deserves full five stars. I leave it to be determined by the reader who revels in such things.",book
177,"I found myself wanting to be able to put things aside in order to get back to reading this book. I wanted to know more about the characters, and found myself suspecting each one in turn. I didn't want to put this one down.",book
274,"I found the writing elegant but the back and forth between the stories of Rachel, Anna and Megan was unnecessarily complex and often repetitive.",book
4692,"Very intriguing plot/story, if you can look beyond the main character's many flaws. It was often very difficult to read from Rachel's point of view, but the suspense in wanting to know what happened to her and Megan will compel you to continue reading.",book
695,"A murder mystery with twists and turns reminiscent of Gone Girl.  Rachel, an unemployed, alcoholic divorced woman, rides the train pretending to go to work every day in order to keep her unemployment a secret from her landlord / roommate.  Every day the train stops at a signal, where Rachel people watches and makes up imaginary scenarios for a couple that lives in a home across the tracks.  One day Rachel sees something shocking and decides that what she has seen will help solve the disappearance / murder mystery of the woman she has been watching from the train.  The police, understandably, do not find Rachel a credible witness.  She becomes increasingly, obsessively involved in this mystery.  Told through the voices of the different characters in the story, jumping back and forth in time, this story is engaging and well written.  I enjoyed it very much.  The reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is because I figured out the end of the mystery about 3/4 into the book.",book
2423,"The first few pages pulled me in; the way the characters or at least the central female characters each got a turn to ""talk"".  I connected with them even if I would not want to be their friend.  The personality of many of these characters frustrated me to no end as one is an alcoholic - and all are self-involved - but then I would imagine the portrayal of the alcoholic was true-to-life.  I know it is with the self-involved individuals.It was interesting to see how deeply you can be involved in someone�s life without actually knowing that person.  It speaks to our voyeur society and the interconnection of events through our life.The end was not predictable although someone might argue that it was wrapped up a bit too smoothly.  I still had questions at the end � so everything was not answered to my satisfaction.Regardless, it was never boring and the pace is fast.  I would like to have another book this minute that would entertain me as this one did.",book
1016,"It was a good enough read to get through quickly, but I felt deflated at the end. It was all about affairs, promiscuity and alcoholism (and murder, of course). There were no likable characters here; even the cops were sleazy. It wasn't clear why Rachel lied so incessantly; it was unnecessary and only got her into more trouble. It just added to her already deeply flawed and unsympathetic character. And at the end, after the trauma she goes through, she miraculously sobers up. Seems like the opposite was more likely. The way it was written, with the back and forth first-person narratives, seemed a bit amateurish.The story was pretty good, and  some character development does occur. But I don't think it comes close to Gone Girl, as some of the reviewers have compared it to",book
3341,"Loved this book! Lots of tension and a good story.  I have to admit that I did figure out ""who done it"" at about 70% of the way through but so did most people, I'm sure.Really creepy and suspenseful. Poor Rachel was just such a mess, I got so frustrated with her and her drinking and her self-pity. Lots of characters to despise in this book - but that is part of what makes it so much fun.Highly recommend.",book
1933,"The storyline of this book never uplifts you. It is all about how everybody lies about his/her past, cheats his / her lover or husband / wife, turns to jealousy, violence, over drinking. It can't even claim to be a study of character - it does not dig profoundly enough for it. Neither is it a real thriller - lacking the action and speed.So what is it ? What did the author seek to accomplish with this story ? What did she seek to teach us ? A mystery to me",book
2723,"I enjoyed this book, though I wish the characters had been differentiated a bit more. It was probably on purpose, showing how suburban and similar the characters are, as well as demonstrating the attraction to certain ""types"" that we all show. Quick tip: pay attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter!",book
3045,"What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren�t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, �How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.�The first person narrators don�t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it�s Rachel if she�s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn�t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn�t disappointed.",book

2357,"I enjoyed the multi-dimensional use of the train in this novel.  (The title of the book, the character of Rachel who is the 'girl on the train' and the views created from the moving train.)  That being said I thought the characters were undeveloped and unrealistic.  Also, unlike others, I did not see a need to compare this book to Flynn's ""Gone Girl"".  Worth the read to resolve the mysteries, but for me it was okay rather than great.",book
654,Great read!! Better than Gone Girl. Can't wait for Paula Hawkins next book.,book

1441,"Excellent story telling. Pay attention to the dates, as the story does skip around a bit in time, but the narrative holds your attention and you wonder about what is actually happening versus what the protagonist sees. I liked the way it evolves into a mystery, and the latter part of the novel is fascinating how the author leads you into the reality of events from the inquisitive mind of our lead protagonist..",book
253,The Girl On The Train is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I read a lot and love suspense thrillers. I loved how fast paced this book was. I didn't get bored. I can usually guess the ending of movies and books pretty quickly but this one took me for a spin! It was exhilarating! I typically don't like when authors go back and forth between characters. If I can't read it in one setting going back and forth gets confusing. Because of how faced paced and exciting this book is I didn't have that problem. I was able to stay interested from the first page until the last. I was able to keep up with each character and loved how each one developed as you go through it. I felt like I was right there with Rachel through all her flashbacks. Definitely a best seller! Paula Hawkins is an excellent writer! Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out. I will be adding Paula to my list of favorite authors too!,book
2864,"I thought the good was very good till the end. It seemed like Rachael made her life much more difficult by not sharing her thoughts and actions with the detectives and other people involved.

2345,I was so excited to read this book after hearing all the hype and rave reviews. However I found the book to be almost tedious. The book's protagonist wasn't a likable character which could have contributed to my wanting it to end. The chapters seemed repetitive. The ending was a bit of a surprise which is why I gave 3 stars instead of 2.,book
3989,I don't know what the hype is about this book. It was actually kind of boring until maybe the last 10%. I wasn't rushing back to it to read more each night. Kind of slogged through it. I'm curious to see how they will execute this plot in movie format.,book
4790,The ending was the best part... If you can make it to the end through the long back and forth readings. It reminded me a lot of the book Gone Girl. It's worth the read but I like a page turner and his just wasn't that for me until the ending .,book
4300,"Absorbing story with that ""I must find out what happened"" feeling about it. A little confusing as it is told in the first person by 3 different women. But worth the effort. Will make a great movie.",book

I was not interested in imagined plots and events and characters that she was constantly engaged detailing.for all I know the first half of the book was just a dream she wrote down.I picked it up again after a month with a fresh approach and the second half of the book is a bit better.I still haven't finished it and unsure whether I will have the interest or energy to try.",book
2546,"Rachel is �the girl on the train�.  She spends her days riding to and from London, usually well on her way to drunken oblivion, in an attempt to keep her roommate from realizing she�s been sacked from her job.  As she rides the train, sipping canned gin and tonics, she becomes obsessed with �Jess and Jason�, a couple whose house backs the tracks.  In her mind, she imagines the happy life they lead based on the glimpses she gets as the train trundles past.  At least until she sees Jess kissing another man on her deck.  When Jess goes missing the very next day, Rachel's reality begins to get significantly more complicated.Hawkins does a fantastic job of taking the facts and tearing them to shreds.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, you turn the page and poof, your theory implodes.  This is a page-turner that is packed with twists and turns you never see coming.  This is not a beach-read, however.  Make sure you have time to invest if you plan to see it through.",book
2954,"LOVED IT!!!!! This book kept you guessing from the beginning on what was going on!! I read through it quickly and was annoyed when I had to put it down.

2825,"The book was a gift to my sister, she thoroughly enjoyed.P.S. this is not really related to the book but sort of a spoiler if you haven't seen it but in the book the main character is in London and drinks Gin and Tonic. If you see the movie she's in NY state and drinks Vodka.",book
2212,"While I did finish ""The Girl on the Train,"" it was far too long. Many of the sections narrated by Rachel were repetitious and could have been eliminated.

Had it been slightly shorter it would have been more enjoyable.",book

Talented author; hope to see more of her.",book
2192,"I enjoy a good mystery and I was provided with one.  Tom's motives were a little weak.  I suspect that he was a more complicated character than the author revealed.  The women were universally weaker than I wanted them to be.  What happened to the red-haired man?  Rachel's turning away from alcohol so suddenly is questionable.  Despite all of this, the plot made the book a worthy page-Turner.",book
337,"The story starts of from the viewpoint of a woman so depressed and in such psychic pain that she regularly drinks herself into oblivion. She lost her husband, her job , rents a small bedroom from a friend, and  pretends  to take the train to work each day and sees  the back of houses on her old street as she goes into London.  She daydreams about a  couple a few doors down from where she used to live  and she occasionally  sees one or both of them and others as the train passes.  She imagines their life together as perfect and as what she had so longed for.  She is so devastated about being left for another woman who had her ex-husband's baby and she feels so sad that she lost him and agrees with him that she was to blame.  The sad part is, she had  been systematically taken apart, her pride, her will , her sense of self , by  a sociopath who enjoys seducing, controlling, and then draining women of any sense of worth and when he succeeds, abandons them as they are unworthy.  Some tiny little glimmer in her peeks out  and she ends up intervening in the life of the husband of the young couple  when  the wife disappears and the husband  is a suspect (and she has seen another man with the wife).  Very difficult to read and harder to put down and, while true to itself, nothing is as it seems.  Psychological thrillers are not my favorite, this was recommended by a friend, and was compelling.",book
4463,"In the mood for a mystery, I dove into this pretty well-reviewed tale. Were it not for wanting to see if the killer was who I thought it was, I finished it. As a mystery, I found it wanting but, worse, as a story, it has an appalling number of shallow and seemingly stupid women. The men don't come off much better. One character, while na�ve, was recognizable, even appealing. Another, a practicing alcoholic was so excessive in her commitment to being drunk daily I could just about smell the liquor. A good mystery balances on credibility. I found this had none.",book
1498,"First couple chapters were a little confusing with all the different entries, but that was part of the intrigue.

Can't wait to read more titles from Paula Hawkins.",book
1232,"The story started slowly and was confusing because it kept changing characters.  It was written as each character was telling a story from their point of view.

It certainly won't be the last!This is a brilliantly crafted story, told by multiple characters, all of whom are unwillingly woven into this web of mystery.Rachael, the drunken ex-wife of Tom seems to be the first one to begin to  ""stir"" this story that will keep you glued to its pages right up to the end.  Be patient in the beginning, when all the characters are having their say about this ""stew.""  You won't regret it!",book

Then I saw a trailer for the upcoming movie and I thought that looks good so maybe I will try once more to read the book.  I did go back to it, stuck with it, and once the other characters who narrate the story get involved in telling their side of the story, it all made sense and became a good read to the point that I had to find out who committed the dastardly deed.  I was surprised at the ending.  Stick with it; I think you will be glad you did.",book

Once I became used to the format, I was riveted by this story and couldn't wait to see what the next chapter or train ride would bring.  If you haven't read this book yet, pay attention to dates as well as which character is telling the story so you can see the big picture of this drama playing out.  I loved how my feelings toward the characters kept changing as the author revealed more about them. I would give this one a big thumbs up!",book
2065,"This books is pretty good-- not amazing. Many others have already given a synopsis, so here are my pros/cons:Pros:-The book is a quick read and is entertaining.- I liked the overall story quite a bit (the writing style was lacking)- I hate when I solve the mystery too early. This one had me guessing for quite some time, and the ending was believable-- accomplishing both of those tasks is rare.Cons:- The writing style. The story is told in first person from 3 different characters, but the style never changed from character to character. They felt one-dimensional and the change in perspective seemed more like a device to tell the story than anything else.- I didn't like any of the characters. This doesn't bother some people, but I like having someone to root for.- While the ending was believable, it felt rushed. Once you figure out what happened, you get about 10-15 pages of resolution.I'd recommend this book as a fun, (relatively) cheap read. Not a must-read by any means, but I enjoyed the book.",book
969,"I very much enjoyed this book...I was easily caught up in the downward spiral of the main character and found her both appealing and repulsive.  Some of her actions seemed uncharacteristic, but since I am not an alcoholic, I may not be the proper judge.  The writing is very good and the character development, though a little spotty for the ancillary characters, was pretty intense for the main character.  I subsequently saw the film and enjoyed it just as much.  It definitely was a benefit to have read the book.",book

I also found it particularly hard to like ANY of the six focused character. I DID like that they all had fatal flaws, etc. The ending was pretty damn well written. Kept me on the edge of my seat for the last fourty or so pages.",book
3666,"I understand the creativeness of the storyline, but it was just not my type of writing.  I found myself avoiding reading it, but being a compulsive reader, I would not put it away for another book- I was bound and determined to finish it.Maybe I just couldn't focus on the names. For a while i mistakenly thought that Rachel was delusional and was actually Meagan and Ann.  I was confused- maybe because of the Jason and Jess thing...Anyway, I am glad I finished, but sort of wished I hadn't started.",book
2060,"I wanted to like this book - at its most fundamental level, the story line is a good one and could have been addicting. The problem, as some other reviewers have pointed out, is that there is not one single likable person in this entire novel. I need a character I can latch onto - protagonist, antagonist, hero, or heroine. Yes people are inherently flawed, but the characters in this book are overwhelmingly rotten awful people - all for very different reasons, but still. In the end, I truly did not care what happened to a single one of them and that made this an incredibly difficult book to finish.",book

1456,I read this for a book club and it was good. It wasn't great because the beginning was slow moving and I had a few moments where I thought I wouldn't make it. But it picked up midway and I thoroughly enjoyed the book after that! I guessed some things right and a few took me by surprise! Which is good for me because I usually figure things out. I would recommend this book. Going to see the movie this week with my book club girls!,book
3559,"I will say this book has a nice twist at the end, but I almost didn't finish the book. I've never read a book where NOT ONE single character is likeable. The story has five main characters: Rachel, Anna, Tom, Megan, and Scott.  Megan goes missing...but honestly, if all five went missing at the same time, that would have made the book more bearable. I could not sympathize with any characters and hoped they would all perish somewhere in the story. I will say Paula Hawkins at least makes the book worth finishing with a good ending.",book

There were times when the story drags, but not too many.  I really enjoyed the fact that Rachel, Megan and Anna were very different women, however they do have a lot in common.  Their stories could fit into many of our lives.  I think as the days pass and I find myself still thinking about the story, I have realized that maybe I liked it more than I thought.",book

696,"I got off to a slow start, had to re-read the beginning to keep the key characters apart.  The three primary characters are all speaking in first person so at first they were all running together, to me.  But after the first few chapters, it hooked me.

I've lived paralleled similarities to Rachel and can't wait to see the movie too.  Keep up the great writing Mrs Hawkins, I'll be keeping an eye out  for your next masterpiece!",book
4514,The story starts out a bit slow but then gains speed in the middle. At first I was annoyed by the way Rachel was drinking but when I found out why it made sense. I felt like she was a character I could not relate to but after hearing her trials I felt like she was a friend and I was hoping she would turn out for the better. Definitely a good read!,book
4708,"It is an interesting story told from multiple points of view. I was intrigued, but none of the characters are particularly likable. It is a well written, gritty story.",book
464,"This book was ok. The blackouts of the main character seem a stretch, especially toward the end of the book. While I like the premise of the story unfolding through different character voices, the development of each character is shallow. You know each of the characters has demeaning, undesirable qualities, but they are just blah and predictable. The only nice character, Cathy, comes across as a doormat.As the book progresses, it becomes very predictable, which is disappointing. Without divulging too much information about specific characters, I felt at loose ends wondering what happened with some of the remaining characters. The ending was somewhat abrupt, almost as if the author had reached her quoto of pages and decided to call it quits before tying up the loose ends.I did see some style, plot, and character similarities  between this author and Gillian Flynn, however, Flynn's writing is more developed. I wouldnt say the book was a total wash, but I fail to understand the rave reviews.",book
2283,I bought this book about 6 months ago but had not gotten around to reading it until now.  I absolutely loved it!  This ranks as one of my favorite reads for this year.  It only took me two days to read it as I was hooked from the beginning.  I loved the twists and turns of the plot and was really surprised at the ending.  Now I know why this has been on the best seller list for so long.,book
1629,"The tone changes throughout the novel as the main character's speculation about the people she observes from the train changes, especially when one of the residents along the tracks disappears.  Then the reader begins to wonder about the mental state of ourmain character and why she is so interested in these people, and IF she possibly had something to do with the missing person as well.She meddles with the investigation and the reader has to wonder if that changes the outcome.  More of her own past is revealed throughout the book.",book
812,"This book was selected to be read in my monthly book club. Unlike some book clubs, we actually read the books! I really wanted to like this book but I just found it really difficult to keep the characters straight. I was constantly trying to remind myself who was who and flipping back to previous chapters to make sure I knew which character the author was referring to. This was just not a good book for me. I probably have ADD or ADD tendencies so this book did not help with that at all. I will say that there is a great plot twist at the end - I considered this to be my reward for hanging in there until the end.",book
3729,"I did enjoy the way the author wrote the book although I'd have to glance back at times to see who I was reading about. However, I must admit this was the first novel I've read in a long time where I did not like even one character.",book
350,Wow...this book had many twists and turns...really enjoyed it..there were times when I could not put the book down..Great Read,book
2224,I read into the 2nd chapter and just couldn't get any further.  Very unusual for me as it is extremely rare for me to give up on a book but I just wan not enjoying it.  I had been anticipating reading it from all the hype I had heard about it so was disappointed to find myself struggling to develop any interest or enjoyment in the story.,book
760,Easy reading,book
3234,"I liked how it kept you guessing till almost the end.I don't care for books where I can anticipate what will happen during not just the ending but throughout the telling of the story.The thing that I didn't like is that the writing and dialogue don't match the location.It is written as if it takes place in America.I'm surprised, as this would be the critique of any first year writing teacher or writing group.However,this made it easier to read.",book
4074,"This is one of those books when you finish you just to have to ponder it for a few minutes.  I thought it was a good book because I had to finish it, but I can't say I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The main character is not exactly endearing--most alcoholics are not--but she had a willing and good heart.  This is a terrible pun but reading this book is like staring at a train wreck you just can't look away and therefore I just  to see how it all sorted out in the end.  While this doesn't seem like a favorable review I'd loved for my friends to read just so we could talk about the balance of the relationships between characters.",book
4434,"Too much hype. I really expected more. Modern day women allowing themselves to be abused by men. Sorry, I don't see how this book received any good reviews. It was difficult to finish and a disappointing ending.",book
933,I was disappointed given the large number of stars many readers gave this book. I think 3 neurotic characters is way too much for a story - I felt like I was bouncing back and forth among the storied women and none of them evolved into a substantive character.,book
489,"This is one of the best mysteries or novels I have read in a long time.  The story is about a woman, Rachel, who has been destoyed by the betrayal by her husband.  He left her for another woman and he and the new wife now have a baby.  This was a goal which Rachel dreamed of even spending thousands on experimental fertility procedures.  Her husband claims they couldn't spend anymore for that, but that it was all right to take expensive vacations..  After the divorce, Rachel drinks too much and loses her job.  However, she continues to ride the train into London making believe she is still employed.  Each day she passes her old neighborhood, an upscale subdivision where her ex-husband now lives in her house with his new wife and baby.  Down the street is another couple, a beautiful perfect couple, and Rachel begins to dream that this could have been her and her husband if only her dreams turned out.The author spins a story of intrigue and lies among married couples and the terrible tricks that are played.  She drops clues along the way, and the reader needs to be watchful and gather them up.  I recommend this very highly.  I believe this is a first novel, and I can't wait to read Ms. Hawkins next book.",book
392,"I'm flabbergasted by the rave reviews, especially that there are 17,500+ mostly positive reviews. At the 20% mark, I debated ending the boredom since nothing had happened yet. Once I got to about 50%, I was still bored and confused about what all the fuss what about because still nothing much had happened. But I slogged through and finished, and I'm still shaking my head. Not one of the seven main characters is likable. Most of them drink heavily. The pacing is slow and repetitive. The book felt so amateurish that I really question what has happened to the reading public that books like this and Gone Girl, another poorly written and over-hyped mess, are so popular. Are books with fully developed characters and carefully crafted plots too challenging for people? I just don't get it.",book
2151,"Really good, but massive trigger warnings for intimate partner violence/domestic abuse and a few other things that are spoiler-ish. Basically the brilliance of the of this story and its darkness is not in the fantastical but in the mundanity -- the worst things that happen to Rachel and Megan and Anna are things women suffer regularly. That is terrifying indeed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't sleep afterward. It's a must-read if you can handle the subject matter but word of advise -- don't read this alone in a dark house. Learn from my mistake.",book
2380,"My sister had raved about this book so I made it a point to buy it when a discounted price became available.  Hawkins writes well and her story is quite good but I have never met a bunch of less likeable characters.  Perhaps, as a very literal person, I missed her point if Hawkins intended to portray everyone so negatively, but I like at least one person to root for in a book.  The central character was incredibly weak and seemingly proud of her inablity to pull herself out of her neediness and addicton.  The other characters were angry, selfish, violent, and/or not terribly bright.I will credit Hawkins with keeping the ending fairly opaque until near the end but this is not a book I particularly enjoyed.  Plus now I have to fib to my sister.",book
1414,"I bought this book on Monday and finished it on Thursday...it was that thrilling. I didn't love this book, though, and now I feel like I need to read something light and fluffy. It's very dark with little warmth or humor to balance the sinister. Everyone who's compared this book to a Gillian Flynn book is right...the books have that same dark feeling. The story itself is all right, but at the end I badly wanted to know a little more about what happened to the characters.This would be a good book to take to the beach-it's an easy read. I bought the Audible version at a reduced price and the narrators are great.",book
3079,This book kept me up late at night because I had to know what happened next. The story was told from three different characters' points of view and from two different points in time.  There were lots of twists and turns and nothing was what you would expect.  I highly recommend this book.,book
3253,"I got this because the movie was coming out, knowing nothing about it. Paula Hawkins really knows how to hit you right in the feels. I was feeling Rachel's anxiety throughout that whole book. Amazing character development. Read in a few sittings. Highly recommend.",book

4957,"It is not the great novel I expected. Honetsly quite deceiving. Poor litterature and quite predictable in the end. I finshed the book though! It is true that catches you in a way you really want to know what will happens next. So in the end, I gave it 3 starts",book
4019,So many people living a lie. The characters drawn into the story and the twist each character adds to the story. I had an idea as to how it would end but the storyline. Kept me from being sure until the end,book
2773,"I wasn't going to read this after reading the reviews, but something about the plot just piqued my interest and I gave in. So glad I did! This book kept me on my toes and guessing up until the last minute, I loved it. Readers really have to pay attention however because there are many different perspectives to follow. The overall story may be a teenie bit cliche but it's so brilliantly told that it doesn't even matter. I recommend this incredibly engaging book, you won't regret it.",book
3416,"This book is an excellent, impossible-to-put-down read. The story line is compelling, the main character frustrating yet relatable, and throughout it all an intense mystery that keeps the reader on their toes. It is definitely meant for adults, but I highly recommend it!",book
2644,"This novel was slow-going at first. The characters were all flawed. However, the story soon turned into a ""page turner"" and I was determined to reach the end as soon as possible. Who hasn't peered into the windows of strangers and imagined what their lives might be like? I enjoyed the book very much. I did not give it 5 stars because of the ""slow"" start and the fact that there really weren't any heroes/heroines in this tale.",book
2754,"I'm still not sure how this book got onto ANY bestseller list. The writing is juvenile and the plot is weak! It's only saving grace is that it is a quick read. But for me, it's still three nights' worth of reading time that I will NEVER recover. If you like totally cheesy lifetime movies, this book is right up your alley!",book
2640,"Well written tragic thriller about how people delude themselves about the causes of the sadness and loneliness in their lives. Rachel, the main character, drinks a lot to combat her depression and isolation. Unemployed, she rides the trains, observing the activities of her ex-husband and the neighbors. What starts as curiosity mixed with drunken fantasy evolves into an investigation that eventually gets her back on the road to peace, health and sanity.",book
3394,"This was a fascinating read. Rachel used her imagination to occupy her mind when she was on the train.  The characters living in the  the homes along the track soon would become people she would know and interact with. Rachel who was presented as a pitiful character whom others disliked would be a heroine,.",book
527,"The novel is perfectly paced, even though I know some who said it was really slow in the beginning. I, personally, prefer when the author takes us into the minds of his/her characters, showing us who they are, what they want, what they dream about. I like a slow burn. I don�t need to jump into the action on page three. But it is just me.The main female characters are drawn beautifully. One is an obsessed wreck of a woman. Another is a manic, complicated and a very unhappy girl. Finally, the third woman is a mistress who becomes the second wife, and who gleefully gloats about it. What�s not to love about this assemble of women?The story is twisted. The plot is tight. The main narrator is unreliable because most of the time she is drunk and cannot remember anything. Important details are presented to us methodically. Our fist impressions of each character are slowly warped by each unexpected and twisty revelation. You will question everything and everyone.In the end, however, you will be greatly satisfied. The ending is immaculate.",book
1731,"The real shame is that Alfred Hitchcock is dead and therefore unable to film this book. It echoes some of his classics - you will find touches of ""Rear Window,"" ""Spellbound,"" and ""Suspicion,"" mixed with a heavy dollop of a famous non-Hitchcock work, ""Gaslight.""Other reviewers have given summaries, so I won't attempt to do it here; I would be too afraid to leave potential spoilers. All I can say to those idly picking it up is to stay with it: for quite a few pages I just wasn't, as they say, ""feeling it."" Suddenly it snapped on me like a mousetrap and I couldn't escape its grasp.",book
1445,"This may be the buzz book of the year but if you are looking for Gone Girl you will be disappointed. The characters are not well developed and by the end when all is revealed, I just didn't care that much. I don't mind unreliable narrators, it can make a novel all the more interesting, but I do not enjoy spending time with drunks which is how the main narrator, Rachel, is described. I don't think that she ever becomes sympathetic which is fine but you have to care about some character in the novel to keep reading and I don't know that any of them fills that bill. If I hadn't been reading this on a plane, I would have given up on it.",book
3869,I loved this book. It was full of suspense and had more twist than I am use to in a thriller. Even the last few chapters after everything is said and done have twist in them. Loved this book and would recommend it.,book
2984,"Number two on the best seller's list, so naturally I had to read it.  I hate stories that jump back in forth in time trying to keep up with what day it is and who is talking.  The storyline was good; just not told very well.  All the characters in the book are morons, no one to actually like or care about what happens to them.  As like others, I had to keep reading just to see who did what, and I had it picked out from the beginning.",book
84,"Put aside plenty of time to read this book.I am always looking for books that are character driven.  The main protagonist is damaged, broken and an alcoholic.  She is not someone that welcomes warm and fuzzy moments.  Her life has been spiraling out of control for some time.  Her choices and habits come back to bite her on a regular basis.It took a while for me to engage with this character.  As an addict in recovery, this book cause me to squirm quite a bit.  I've lived her story in many ways.  I had to overcome my comfort level to continue to read this book.  I am glad I did.There are so many layers to this book.  It is the proverbial onion, complete with aspects that sting the eyes to near tears.The plot has so many twists and turns.  It is very much like that rollercoaster that you avoid at all costs.  Your friends and family tease you, prod you, yet you steadfastly say never.  Next thing you know, you are on that rollercoaster, unsure the bar across will hold you in.  After wards, you are asked whether you enjoyed it.  With a wry smile, you say quietly, ""Yes, yes I did.""The many reviews of this book may not do it justice.  I suspect the intrepid reader will find within its nooks and crannies a very satisfying read.",book
2673,"As an avid reader, I had to delve in before the movie release. We all know it's hard to reproduce a great book, and I imagine the screenwriter's had a heck of a time with this one. It's quite hard to follow at first, but it does come together nicely if you can keep all the stories straight. It's a twisting, turning, unsuspected ride.",book
1370,"I hesitated to read this book, since some previous reviews made me think it was a take off of Gone Girl--which I really liked, but felt I didn't need to read this book..  However since Emily Blunt is starring in the upcoming movie and I love her so will see the movie, I decided I wanted to read the book. It was cold and rainy today, so I started the book this morning and couldn't put it down--finished it all today.Well written and I couldn't figure out the ending until towards the very end.",book
4048,"A. Book with a slow start that can only pick up as more lives are involved. In our book club someone called it Hitcockese, but I'm not sure I would. I gave it five starts because I thought it always had a story with a purpose.",book
3689,"Excellent story, well written. Unexpected ending and great characters. It goes to show that you cannot even trust your own shadow and that memories can also be lies or constructed as such. Five stars. Hoping the movie does it justice.",book
1791,"The Girl On The Train was an easy Summer read, easily finished in a couple of days. None of the characters in the book are likable people, but that lends more to the story than detracts from it, or it could have if the author had provided a little more character development for a couple of the characters. The main character, Rachel, is a divorced alcoholic who wastes her time daydreaming about the lives of strangers while in denial of what a mess her own life has become. Her ex-husband has moved on with a new wife and has a child, but she is in denial about her place in his life. She spends her days riding a train from her flat to London, and each day, she passes by their house -- her former house. When she interjects herself into the lives of strangers, she ends up embroiled in a missing persons case. Because she drinks too much and lies too much, her sincere desire to help comes across as attention-seeking and unstable. Her constant lies hurt the victims and only make her look more insane. When she starts telling the truth, nobody believes anything she says. The ending was somewhat contrived, but there had to be an ending, and better this one than one of the alternatives, I guess. The reasoning behind the perpetrator's actions were hidden from the reader for too long. Everything that could have been discussed throughout the book was shoved into the last few pages. By the end, I was satisfied and enjoyed it, but it could have been tweaked for a bit more suspense.",book
705,"I found the main character, Rachel, so pathetic at first that I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish this book.  Since it was was selected by our book club, I pushed myself to keep reading.  It did get better but was pretty predictable. The story is about a women who watches a couple from the morning train while she commutes into London.  She watches them out on their back patio and has made up fictional names and fictional lives for them.  One day she sees something that doesn't look right to her and this puts her in a tailspin.  Her ex-husband happens to live a few doors down from this couple with his new wife that he left Rachel for in her old house.  This complicates things because she cannot let go of the fact that she is still in love with her ex so she ends up stalking him which puts her in a position to stalk the other couple as well.  There are lots of twists to the story but I saw a lot of them coming before they happened.",book
2327,"I ENJOYED  THIS BOOK.,  SINCE MY STROKE I HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING A STORY LINE, II WILL ADMIT I HAD TO GO BACK AND REREAD SOME PAGES,  BUT I REALLY  ENJOYED  THIS NOVEL ANDI IT WAS FAIRLY EASY FOR ME TO FOLLOW.!",book
2735,"I know I was supposed to enjoy this book, but I did not. It took me over two months to work thru the first 80% bc it was just too slow, finally I got hooked and finished the last 20% in one night. It was the first book I considered quitting, but I'm glad I stuck it out.",book
3210,"It started out interestingly enough but went downhill quickly. I started skimming because the plot moved so slowly & story became grindingly repititous. Typical Hollywood or TV's Lifetime movie ending. Really disappointing.  No creativity here. Probably written in hopes of selling movie rights. The hype was just that, hype to sell the book. Interesting characters and format but just didn't hold my interest. Couldn't wait to be done with it!",book
4051,"After enduring my wife's prodding to read this book hovering atop the best seller list for so long, I read it, and marvel with great admiration at the superb marketing that propelled a middling story of totally screwed up people to make so much money. It's not that there is anything wrong with it--after all I kept reading,but wonder why. I still recommend it if you have nothing better to do.",book
3109,"I found this  book to be very interesting in how it was written.  Instead of chapters,  it's written by the perspective of the characters themselves.  It was suspenseful and I enjoyed the ending.  It kept me guessing.  Would recommend to those that like suspenseful books.  You won't be disappointed.",book
2746,"Although I did figure out some of the plot lines, I still found it very compelling and it definitely was hard to put down.  I know the movie is coming out soon so I'm glad I got to read it before seeing the movie--although since I saw the trailer before I read the book, it kind of ruined my own image of the main character.",book
3894,"This was the first time I ever read Hawkins, but I was certainly intrigued. At the time that I read this book, I was on a big psychological/mystery binge combined with a bit of  contemporary chick-lit. This book balances all the genres beautifully! I love being unable to predict the end of a book, as it keeps me humble and engaged.I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to branch out of being ""stuck"" in one type of genre. This book will make transition easy!",book

I think the characters are interesting and although I did figure out a portion of the ending, I had to keep reading to see if I was correct.  This was a book club read and I think there is plenty to discuss at our meeting.",book
4025,Well written and liked the idea of telling the story from the perspective of 3 different characters in the story. There was something about the setting and the description of the street that evoked life in Britain for me even though it is 15 years since I left the UK.,book
996,"I've read other excellent reviewers who found the changes in POV and changes in time confusing, but for me they worked quite well.  In fact, the story and the suspense wouldn't have worked without these jumps and I very much liked trying to figure out who thought what when.  All 3 female characters (the 3 POVs) have their perspectives, their differences, and their psychological limitations, so being inside each separately adds to the plots tension.  It's hard to believe that this is a first novel by Paula Hawkins and I look forward to her next.  The Girl on the Train is a fast read and I recommend it highly.",book
3365,"I got so annoyed with the main character, her stupidity at times was SO annoying - I continued to read this book more out of curiosity. I did want to know what happened.  So the author did capture that for me. I didn't have any attachment to the main character and am unsure what the author was hoping to portray with this quirky, insecure, girl, whom you wished to shake at times - though I guess I've answered myself - it generated a reaction.Its a readable book, but not what I expected from this author.",book
4124,"The author writes very well.  It was a little tough to read, not because the writing style isn't great, but because the character is not in a good place and she made me a little uncomfortable because of her bad choices.  It was essential to the story to be written that way.  Interesting story and the plot is carried out very well.  I enjoyed the book very much.",book
2321,"This book failed to deliver anything even remotely entertaining.  The characters are all so dysfunctional and flawed that it's impossible to connect to any of them.  It's a pain trying to keep the time-line straight as it jumps around too much from the perspective of three different unlikeable women.  Half-way through the book I was praying they'd all get hit by the train.  The ending was predictable, there were no twists or surprises.  Just dull and boring from start to finish.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!",book
1396,"If you would like to read a story about vapid characters who are self absorbed and justify all their actions where even the ""hero"" is so unlikeable go ahead and buy this book. I was interested when ads for the movie were released and as I read it I kept hoping for something redeeming to be revealed and it never came. I read one review that said ""you don't have to like the character to care about that character"". Um... yes you do!",book
2206,"Having read Gone Girl and hearing the hype for this book, I expected more than was delivered.  I thought that the plot was over-complicated; it was difficult to distinguish characters and motivations because, especially at the beginning, the reader had to decipher ""who was who.""  I never was able to sympathize or identify with any of the characters.  They were all significantly flawed; I could not understand the motivation of any of the three women--they each found a way to manufacture their own dismal destiny without finding a way out of the mess.  They each allowed themselves to be manipulated by the males in the story; are women really as desperate as this??I also thought that the plot was bogged down by repetitive reflections.  How many times can we go to the ""underpass"" without becoming suspect of the events?  Once it was established that Anna was not available in the scene, the predictability of  the final event was obvious.I kept wanting at least one of the characters to be redeemable . . . someone whom I could feel controlled his/her own outcome.  But, not one really stepped up to the plate.  Circumstance ruled each one; human will did not stand a chance.",book
2917,"I began reading with a bias toward not liking it because I'm a sucker for negative reviews, but I ended up really liking this book. It had a sublime redemptive quality, and I did not find it at all predictable. I also disagree with the simplistic ""unreliable narrator"" take. I'd say more, but enough's been said already. Just don't dismiss this book because of the negative reviews. I almost did and am very glad I didn't.",book
906,"At first, it was difficult to get into the story. A bit confusing and a lot of back and forth between characters and dates. Fortunately, for me, there were only three character's point of view. I finished the book in three days. The first day was arduous, but once I started again, the second day, it was almost challenging to put the book down. Finally, on the third day, I couldn't stop until I finished it. Surprising twist at the end and at times I suspected it could be..., but then thwarted the idea of it being so. Definitely a great, suspenseful read.",book
2719,"Every one of the characters is messed up. There is this range of emotion you feel sorry, sad, mad and you just want to shake each one of them until the get their act together.

531,Not my style.,book
3345,"If this is a best seller I will be,very cautious to read another highly rated book. I found so much lacking in the continuity of the plot.

182,"I do find myself agreeing with several other readers that the main character was a touch difficult to connect with. At least at first.As the story unfolded and the end grew ever closer, it became clear why she'd fallen into her drinking habits and why her life was such a mess.However, I will say that if you've spent as much time reading these sorts of thrillers and studying them as I have, you may not be quite as shocked at the big reveal as others. I had it figured out several chapters ahead of time, but reading the characters reactions was still enjoyable.Overall, a fairly decent thriller!",book
3737,"At first I had trouble keeping the characters clear......I had to keep back-tracking to see which person the next chapter was about.  Once I had that under control, the book is a great read - not what I expected at all!  Towards the end I figured out the 'who done it' but loved the style of this book.  Will I read this book again?  YES, for sure!  If you are looking for a great read - this is it!",book
2000,Great book with well developed characters. I wish there was one male that could have been a role model.  It's almost like the person who wrote it sees all men as cruel and uncaring of women.,book
1281,"It was interesting... It certainly gave insight into depression, addiction, illicit love affairs and deception in marriage.  The end was a little weak..... And rather predictable by mid way through the book.Having said that, it was interesting to read how the ""girl"" could make up entire lives for people that she just passed by for a few minutes each day, and you came away thinking that she really needed to get a life of her own!  I hope that she eventually did.",book
3332,"Beware, before you know it you will be sucked into this story and won't be released until you read the last page. Even then, you'll be thinking of the story long after reading the last page. In the beginning, it was a little difficult to determine just who was narrating and about whom but the writing was such that you kept going. I would imagine most people who ride a train or bus that stops routinely, fantasize about the people they see or who lives in the homes they pass. This story takes that premise one step further when one of the people disappears. The prose is easy to read, descriptive with good character development and the plot twists and turns may give you whiplash. The Girl on the Train is a really good read.",book

2312,"Outstanding psychological novel. The author takes you on a wild journey through the eyes of the three women in the story. Not until near the end does the terrible truth begin to reveal itself. On the way there, you are buffeted by the stories of the protagonists, live their anguish and their hopes, move with them through the landscape of the tale. I haven't been so engrossed in a novel for some time. One of those books you can't wait to finish to find out what happens but then feel devastated that it's over. A masterpiece.",book
4627,"A great read. I polished it off in 3 nights. LOL. Of course, i had to ignore my husband to do that. Gripping story, great plot. Can totally see this as a movie. Fast paced. Only one or two sections were a bit slow. I wasn't really a fan of the ending, but over all a very satisfying story with lots of twist and turns. Aummer is coming...take this to the beach and enjoy!",book
4794,"I've heard this book compared to ""Gone Girl"". I resisted reading it for so long because of that. It is much better in my view. I found the lead character, Rachel, to be very complex.  The ending was not what I expected at all.  I can't stand books that are predictable and this definitely was not.",book
207,"Well, I'm just a regular reader, no professional reviewer or anything, but I have a lot to say about this amazing book.This ingenius novel is a fascinating look at how everybody is very different, everybody is a little similar, and those similarities and differences can twist together in amazing ways in the end.The characters are very human, being both likable and, at the same time, people we can't help but look down on.  But the characters' complexity emerges as the book gets further along, so that before you know it, you've been guilty of character assassination when you shouldn't have been.  You've been rooting for things you shouldn't have been.  You've been caught up in things in all the wrong ways.  And it happened to you right under your own nose.This book is a great ride! Twisting, turning, pulling you around.  I am an avid reader, and even I was surprised.By the time the ending is approaching, a moral has actually formed in your mind.  You don't even realize it because you've had such a good time.  But a while after you are done with the book, if you take the time to think about it, it's there.What a great book.",book
1789,"I started this book quite a while ago and put it down bc the many characters' narratives were confusing and I got tired of trying to keep them straight. When the movie was announced I decided to give it another try. Once I decided to pay more careful attention to the change in voices and got to know the characters better, I got sucked in so strongly that I couldn't put it down! Another family member had the same experience! Now I'm delighted I gave it a second chance. I must admit to have guessed at the culprit about half way through, but the way that was revealed was terrific. And now I can't wait to see what they do to the story in the movie.",book

None of the characters were likeable, except Evie, and I'm not sure if she even counts-- she was more of a prop. The writing was decent, which saves it from a one-star rating. If you want a book that focuses on three women, read Liane Moriarty's _Big Little Lies_.",book

I'm sad and annoyed that I spent the money on this one, which is why I feel the need to read to the end.  All of the characters are annoying, thin, shallow, and fairly bland.  The main character is amazingly stupid with her constant whining about messing up and then doing the same things over and over.  The worst part is having to read the same scenes and thoughts repeatedly . . . talk about boring!  I saw the ending after the first couple of chapters, but kept telling myself ""no, this has to get better than that!""  It didn't.  I'm honestly surprised and appalled that so many people enjoy this book.  It's nothing new or interesting past the free preview section, in fact it's just more of the same contrived garbage all the way to the obvious and bland ending.  Where are the good and enjoyable novels anymore?  Not here, I can promise you that!",book

1810,At first it threw me off when the author would switch the character who was telling the story from time to time but I quickly came to like this change of perspective. I began this book without having read much about it and I'm very much the type of person who will read the first few pages and either decide it's a book I'll like or move on to something else and it didn't take long to decide that I would enjoy this novel.

The book is told from the point of view of different characters but they all sound the same. Not to worry, you know you're reading about the main character if she is constantly worried about her next drink.This trend of going back and forth, writing chapters from the perspective of different characters and at different times (which she also does) can be the mark of a lazy writer.

The ""Girl"" rides past the houses every morning and evening, and she can observe some of the activities at the various houses, as she is able to see into the windows and backyards.All of the characters have issues; the ex is still not over her failed marriage and she had, and still has, problems with alcohol.  This causes others to dismiss her observations and input.Suspense builds and then one of the wives is found dead.  Most of the main characters could have been responsible, as well as some minor characters who are introduced along the way.The story is told from the first-person viewpoint of the 3 women and it toggles back and forth, which seems to be the current style.I found the story unique, engaging, and suspenseful and I felt the ending was not predictable.",book

1333,This book was just painful. I tried several times to read it. When I realized I was forcing myself I quit. Books are meant for enjoyment.  I could not get into the main character.  She was such a mess and she was just depressing. Nothing to draw you into her world. Not sure if it was the character development or writing. I finally scrapped it after numerous attempts and making it through only 7%. I don't generally like reviews that haven't read but this book was just so blah I felt compelled to warn others before spending money. There are so many other great thrillers to read.,book
343,"This story moves, propelling the reader onward.  The author is a good and descriptive writer and gives an immediate impression of the gist of each of the characters she follows.  If you are looking for a suspense read that will pull you in and make you want to finish the book in a weekend, this does the trick.Rachel, the ""Girl on the Train,"" who imagines the lives of a couple whose house she passes every day, is a drunk.  Daily, her train also passes the house she used to call home, now inhabited by her ex-husband and the woman he left Rachel for.  Twice daily on her commute, Rachel alternately mourns for the life she lost (and curses the women who supplanted her) and imagines the perfect couple down the street from her old home whom she views from her commuter's window but doesn't know.  Maybe due to her reliance on being drunk to cope with a life that has severely disappointed her, Rachel often is hesitant to act when contemplating a decision.  This does make some of the chapters repetitious at times, but the author's strong sense of place and use of description largely mitigates this criticism.Comparison's to Rear Window are obvious.  As with the Hitchcock masterpiece, Rachel gets involved when she witnesses an incident from her train that is out of sync with the imagined life of the couple she views every day - the couple about whom she has constructed a vivid, if alcohol fueled, perfect life.  There are a lot of plot twists, though this is the kind of book where most of them are revealed by the three protagonists and not pieced together from a well laid foundation of clues.A good book, quick read and pretty good freshman effort from this author.",book

3354,"Long, dragged out, and boring. I read this book because of all the hype surrounding it. I don't get the stellar reviews, this book was awful. None of the characters are likable, information is included in the book that added zero value to the story. Basically you spend the whole time waiting for an annoying drunk to get her memory back then the book quickly wraps up. Every main female character in this book was deplorable and it took everything in me to muster some kind of like or understanding for them. In real life these are people you hope to never come across.",book
218,"I downloaded a sample of this book quite awhile ago, but never managed to engage. So many people insisted it was the best book they had read this year, so I finally just hunkered down and dug in. The story is captivating enough, so I imagine that that was a big part of what the fuss is all about. And a female alcoholic protagonist is a new twist on the old unreliable narrator. My problem was that I didn't care for the characters. Not that I disliked them, they just left me cold. Plus, it was pretty easy for me to see where the story was headed, about half way through the book. I read on, hoping for a more interesting plot twist, but when the reveal came, it was unrealistic the way that the perpetrator just came right out and blurted all the details of the murder. So, why 4 stars? Because I'm impressed by all the hoopla have and every time an author attracts the kind of readership that encourages others to pick up a book, I put my own subjective opinion aside, to a degree. Right or wrong, keep reading and reviewing!",book

4196,"This is a story of nasty dudes and naive women. I loved it. It�s being compared to Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn, but that�s not a good comparison. They are both amazing in their own ways and for very different reasons. This book has so many questions that have to be answered. Is Megan dead or did she run away? Both are plausible. Why is Rachel so obsessed with her? Is it just her imagination? Why is Tom so passive of Rachel�s constant intrusions? Who is sleeping with who? Does Anna have any redeeming qualities?The characters are flawed and some are downright detestable. The story focuses on three women: Rachel, the drunk who can�t let go of her ex-husband, Anna, the one who stole him away, and Megan, the beautiful missing woman.Rachel was a great character to read. She is completely broken and her only escape is with alcohol. The story is told from first-person perspective and doesn�t have a whole lot of dialogue, so her chapters were desperate and lonely. I could put myself in her shoes. She is someone who is easy to pity, as she travels the train everyday, pretending to go to a job that she was fired from months ago. Every day she looks at a house, only a few down from where she once lived, and watches a loving couple. She creates a make-believe world around them, perfect in every way. It�s an obvious set-up for disappointment.Anna is not likeable. At no point in the book did I feel anything for her but contempt. She knowingly begins an affair with a married man, none other than Rachel�s husband Tom, and effectively steals him away. Granted, Rachel�s depression makes it easy for her. At one point, while she�s admiring her and Tom�s sleeping baby, she remembers the days of sneaking around with him and admits that she misses being a mistress. She loved the sense of danger and wishes she could go back to it. All she feels towards Rachel is disgust. She was a good chunk of the book and suffice it to say that her chapters filled me with my own sense of disgust, aimed at her.Next is Megan, the one I�m not sure how to feel about. Partly, she reminds me of Anna, with her �I don�t care about anyone but me� attitude, but she also reminds me of Rachel, with her struggle against depression and insomnia. Her tragic past is the only part of her character that I could stand, as the rest of the time she�s thinking purely about herself and her memories of when she ran an art gallery and had men drooling over her. Surely, she would be appalled to be compared to Rachel, who is described as being overweight, drunk, and repulsive. Megan�s selfishness is sometimes nauseating, but then a wee bit of humanity shines through. Ultimately, I felt sorry for her, but I didn�t like her.The men in the story are a puzzle. There�s good and bad. It�s a confusing mess and I wasn�t always sure which man I was reading about through these women�s thoughts. Have no fear, the book did not leave me with a total sense of hopelessness concerning men in general, even though the author did not show them in a positive light.It�s definitely a mystery. I had inklings all the way through, but it wasn�t until about seventy percent through that I said, �Ah-ha!� I�m always impressed with a book that can keep me guessing more than halfway through and this one definitely did. It wasn�t a huge surprise to me, but it was an unpleasant one. In the beginning, everything is up in the air. No one is safe from doubt, not even poor Rachel. Nothing is completely settled until the very end, as it should be, leading to a perfectly short and powerful climax.The end was fulfilling, yet a little disappointing. I do not like happy-happy endings, but this one lacked hope. It was hinted at, but only one of these women gets to speak and her thoughts are still terrified and troubled. I would have liked to see more resolution for her. As it was, it felt sort of incomplete. My takeaway is that everyone lives in their own distorted version of reality and when the truth shows up it can have devastating repurcussions. So, don�t lie and don �t cheat.For the rating:Genre and general reading age � it�s a mystery and thriller. Reading age is adult, due to some really difficult scenes and references, including excessive drinking by more than one of the characters. Sometimes I wondered how they were able to stand up.The level of sexuality � for the amount of cheating involved, it was surprisingly mild. There weren�t actual sex scenes, but memories of trysts and a morning after.Was there graphic language? Not much.Did I cry? Nope.Is it part of a series? Nope.Level of character development was very high. Out of the three men and three women who make up the story, only one was a bit weak. The others were strong and I could see them in my mind.Did I laugh? Nope.This was a fantastically-written story and once I picked it up I couldn�t put it down, literally. I stayed up late into the night with this one. I�m happy to give it <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>.5 stars. It was almost perfect.",book
4665,"I mostly listened to the Audible narration instead of reading the book.

2180,"The writing here is fine, but the story is poorly conceived and told.  The three lead women are all one-dimensional and tell their parts of the story in the same voice.  Aside from the chapter titles which tell you who is telling each section the story, the reader isn't able to differentiate the characters by the way they speak or act.  The story is repetitive and introduces a number of red herrings to try and heighten the suspense.  The author chooses to introduce plot points 3/4 of the way through the book in order to move the story along.  There is nothing that leads up to these revelations.  They could have easily been discovered 1/4 of the way through the book, which makes everything in between seem like inconsequential fluff.  There are other things that really annoyed me with the storytelling, specific to the person who committed the crime, but I won't reveal any spoilers here.I give it 2 stars overall, but I can understand why some people enjoy it.  I just had too many pet peeves with the storytelling to rate it any higher.",book

2512,I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this book. Not sure what all the excitement was about regarding this book. It was not a favorite. I found it had a predictable storyline (and ending). Not a fan of flashback or diary style of writing and that might be part of the problem I had with the book. It is written in the same style as Gillian Flynn (and I didn't like her books either). I have friends who loved this book and some that felt the same as I did. YMMV.,book

It introduces several storylines and characters that serve absolutely no purpose other than to try and confuse you and throw you off from guessing who the killer is, who turns out to be exactly who you thought it was from the start.

1893,I had no expectations or information on the novel content when I bought it.  I kept reading it although I found it repetitive and slow at times.  The characters were well developed.  All were unlikeable.  I figured out the plot two thirds through but again kept reading.  I would compare it to Gone Girl which I read some time ago I found that a more interesting and faster paced read. But thinking about it there was a similarity to the style in which is was written may have been what made me less impressed with this novel.,book
2981,"After all the hype that I had been reading about this book,  I honestly expected to be more interested in finding out for myself what it was all about. I have it be honest. In my opinion it was simply boring. I found it very difficult to even become interested in it from the very beginning. Maybe it's just me, but the twists & turns of it all weren't exactly earth shattering. Quite predictable actually.",book
3856,"Starts a little slow, but a gripping tale that unravels the mystery of a missing woman. Every character is petty and broken, which makes for an interesting story. Though, it seems a bit lazy. Overall, it was entertaining and worth a read.",book
4525,My alarm goes off during the workweek at 4:30 a.m. and there have been plenty of mornings since I started this novel when my eyes were bleary from late nights.  A definite thriller and I look forward to reading more from Paula Hawkins.,book
949,"I was excited to read this book because Amazon suggested it was similar to Gone Girl. However except for the multiple point of view format, the book is not great.I had to force myself to continue reading through the poor writing. I believe a good author would use descriptive words, not generalization of moods and character based on brands.( there was a lot of name dropping, was the author beings sponsored by these companies?)The book was shallow, the characters were shallow and I felt uncomfortable with the way women were depicted as weak victims and men as testosterone driven neanderthals.I loved the premise of the book, which is the only thing that kept me reading through the events and characters that were not clever or interesting.",book
1361,"This book starts out in such an intriguing manner.  I was instantly hooked!  Who is this woman?  What is she seeing?  I was speeding through pages faster than the train sped through the London suburbs.And then... The most heavy-handed use of a plot device that I've ever endured.  Ok, ok - I get it! She's an unreliable narrator.  It's as if the author had just taken a writing class based upon the utilization of plot devices. Twice.There was such promise in the novel, but it was sadly squandered by a plot device that was so overbearing that constantly pulled me out of the narrative.",book
20,I am half way through this book and can honestly say I hate it. I can't believe all of the good reviews--I don't understand what all the fuss is about. The character development is weak--and I don't like any of them. It's B-O-R-I-N-G. I would advise you to skip this book and save your money...but obviously some other people like this book. I just don't know why!!!,book
2265,"Couldn't wait to finish the book.  And a twist at the end, just what I like.  Will watch the movie when it comes out and I hear that Emily Blunt is going to Rachel.  Not sure how that will work-I would l think she w/be a Megan.  But she is a good actress and will have to eat more for sure.  Interesting to glimpse into the mind of an alcoholic trying to cope w/a failed marriage.  She likes to torture herself though and does not make good decisions about just about everything.",book
4638,"I was okay. I found the characters hard to believe. If you were not a fan of Gone Girl, you will probably not like this book either. It was just okay. Fairly predictable. It felt like the author was trying to take you on a ride, but it was too forced. I enjoy books that simply tell a good story instead of trying to weave in complex, often unbelievable characters and plot lines just to keep you entertained.",book
3419,"A cleverly written novel with a clever plot. The characters are a divorcee with a drinking problem who cannot let go, an adulterous husband who doesn't live up to his responsibilities, a new wife with a justifiable paranoia, a pregnant adulteress and an abusive husband. They are all linked by one street in the London suburbs with dramatic results. A first novel with very few weak places. I have already ordered Paula Hawkins next novel.",book

3622,A page turner and  very suspenseful..I can hardly wait to see if the movie is as good as the book.,book
991,Interesting at first.  Became a bit tedious and unrealistic as it progressed.  Really-an ex wife walks off with your baby and no one calls the police and they continue to allow her to the house?  It just because. So implausible that it lost its entertainment value.  I also wasn't expecting it to be go dark and depressing.,book
1525,"At first, I didn't understand the hype around this book. I didn't like it. The beginning is really sad. The characters are all very flawed, marred by their own vices. But getting towards the end, the plot suddenly twists and everything you expected to happen doesn't. You thought you knew the characters but then you learn the truth. No one is who you think they are. You're just as surprised as the characters. The author straps you into a rollercoaster of a dramatic triumphant ending.Wow! What an exciting read!",book
1544,"Rachel cannot get over the pain of losing her husband Tom to another woman, Anna.  Every morning when she goes to work on the train and every evening she passes by the Victorian home she once shared with Tom.  Her pain is palpable and excruciating to this reader anyway.  Anyone who has experienced that level of betrayal will be moved by Rachel's pain as she watches Anna not just living in her old home, but with all of its furnishings and decoration all put together with such love and joy, such happiness in her safe, warm marriage with Tom.  Their only disappointment was their inability to conceive the child Rachel so desperately wanted.  They try IVF, but it fails and Tom says he hasn't the money for another round.  This is the beginning of Rachel's slide in deep depression that she self medicates with liquor, finally becoming a full blown alcoholic.  Her pain becomes ever more acute as one morning from the train she sees Anna, belly busting with the result of her fecundity.

But she rides the train anyway to mms make her friend and roommate, Cathy, believe she has a job.  A few door down from her old home there is another house, identical to Rachel's. A young couple live there.  He is strong and protective; she is ethereal,, elegant and blonde.  Rachel names them Jason and Jess and constructs a rich, imaginative and blissful marriage for them.Rachel drinks so heavily that she has blackouts.

But something about the tunnel beneath the train tracks brings up feelings of dread and fear.  Something bad happened here, thinks Rachel.Meanwhile Rachel continues to bother Tom with drunken, tearful phone calls and even goes to seek him out at their old home, which she still thinks of as hers.

Rachel takes it upon herself to play detective leading her to discover to the near loss of her life, the horrifying identity of the killer.",book
1919,"I kept hearing about this book and was really looking forward to reading it.  I've not yet finished it as I've found it very hard to follow the story line, flips back and forth between present and past, and I have to keep going back to put the pieces together.  I think that, unfortunately, I am just reading it too late each evening and too tired to concentrate so I'm planning to start over when I go on vacation and can dedicate more rested reading time to it.  I'll update my opinion after that.",book
1280,"It's been a long time since I read a book that I literally could not put down.  My mom recommended that I read this one, and I was not disappointed.  I took it with me everywhere!!  I did not predict the ending - not just who did it but even at the very end there is a secondary surprise.  Very good read!  I've seen some people ask if it's like Gone Girl, and I have to say it's nothing like Gone Girl.  (For the record, I like Gone Girl, too.)  Definitely read this book but get ready to be caught up in it!!!",book
4160,It was interesting to see the book written from the perspective of three different women. It was a somber look at alcoholism and relationships. The book kept you involved and anxious. It's a great read!,book
976,"From all that I'd heard and read about this book, it still wasn't quite what I expected. It moved slowly in the beginning and was kind of confusing. There were times when I went back and reread to keep the characters straight. It did pick up the pace in the middle and raced to the end, sort of like a train. I thought the characters could be developed more. You only know them superficially. When I finished the book, I still wanted to know more about them and their motives. Still it was a pretty good read and I was sort of surprised at the end.",book
2704,"I enjoyed this book, though I wish the characters had been differentiated a bit more. It was probably on purpose, showing how suburban and similar the characters are, as well as demonstrating the attraction to certain ""types"" that we all show. Quick tip: pay attention to the dates at the beginning of each chapter!",book
971,"What I liked about this book was that the narrators weren�t entirely reliable or likeable. One of my favorite lines comes from Rachel, who is battling alcoholism. She says, �How much better life must have been for jealous drunks before emails and texts and mobile phones, before all these electronics and traces it leaves.�The first person narrators don�t have distinctive voices, so if you put the book down in the middle of a chapter, it will take you a second to figure out who is talking (you can figure out if it�s Rachel if she�s talking about how much she wants a drink, for example.) All in all though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will recommend it to friends because I couldn�t wait to come back to it to find out what happened, and I wasn�t disappointed.",book
620,"Terrible book, couldn't finish it!",book
3583,"I started this book twice. The first time I just could not get into it. The main character was so depressing. But I tried again and eventually the story got better and better. The characters became much more involved and there were some comical moments that made me laugh. Anyway, I did really enjoy the book and was intrigued with the plot and characters. I had to finish. Really good first novel for the author. I gave it a four star because the beginning was difficult and slow.",book

804,"Read this novel and really wanted to love it but I couldn't. It's full of very flawed characters (as is life I suppose) and it's very hard to root for anyone, especially the protagonist. I find it difficult to read a book and feel satisfied when you aren't rooting for anyone. I won't give away any spoilers and I will acknowledge that Rachel ( the protagonist) has had a hard time but at a certain point, you have to rise above your circumstances or the bad hand you've been dealt (don't you?). I'll be interested to see how the movie unfolds as the book is a narrative from the view point of  3 different women. Can't recommend the book.",book
4862,"Definitely entertaining and quick. But I don't like how the author tries to falsely lead you to think things when the truth is already obvious...just gets annoying. Also, the main character is really deplorable and incredible...always kind a downside to a book! It's like a dumbed down version of Gone Girl, which was really masterfully written! But it was a nice, easy read for before bed.",book

287,This book kept me guessing the entire time. I definitely needed s one wine at the end. Great book and can't wait to read more of her books.,book
1521,"I really enjoyed this book, and finished it in about 3 days of picking it up intermittently. It is similar to Gone Girl with the changing voices. You grow to appreciate where each character is coming from. I would definitely recommend this book, but I felt the ending, while a good twist, got a little cheesy. There was so much deep unfolding of the layers as you got through the book, that it seemed like a rush way to wrap it all up into an explanation. Not distractingly bad by any means, but I do think the ending could be slightly better. No matter what, I really enjoyed the journey, though!",book
4926,"I really enjoyed this book from start to finish but I wouldn't compare it to Gone Girl. It's a great read and I found myself eager to get back to it. I wish there had been less hype about this book because I think I was expecting more. If I hadn't read all the hype I would have found it to be a good book but since my expectations were raised, I was a bit disappointed with the ending. Still, an excellent read and one I would recommend.",book

I read ""Gone Girl"" first but ""The Girl on the Train"" is by far my favorite. Fun to read and discuss with a friend as well.",book
3384,"Hated it!  Comparison to Hitchcock is insulting.  If you like drunks that black out again and again and AGAIN and guess what ""I can't remember"", taking forever to get a story told, this book is for you.

1644,"I should have known when I struggled to get through the sample that I wouldn't enjoy this book. I kept reading on hoping it would get better. The suspense is not thrilling, the plot is laughable and the protagonist is absolutely insufferable.

Shouldn't have bothered.",book

3239,"I really enjoyed the way this was written.  It is told from the perspective of the three main women in the book, though mostly from the main protagonists point of view.  It is also told over two different time periods, so we hear the story of one of the women from an earlier timeframe.  It was a light easy read, but the twist on writing style kept it interesting for me, and I ripped through this book in no time.",book
4651,I read this book in one day! I haven't done that in quite a while. I couldn't put it down! I was convinced that I knew who the villain was several times and each time I was wrong! Headed to find more Paula Hawkins novels!,book
2994,"The book is a good, fast read. It doesn't quite live up to the hype--while well written, when all is said and done there is nothing particularly unique about it--but is still worth checking out.The characters are interesting although you could argue not a single one is likable. The killer is also fairy predictable, though how things will unfold isn't quite so much.",book
4930,"This book was an insult to the intelligence of the reader. Poorly developed characters, many of whom with mental health issues, drag on in a story line that could be good but, is not.  The plausibility of the events is outrageous and depressing.  Skip this corkscrew of a novel.",book
4686,I bought this book because a colleague recommended it. I'm a recovering alcoholic (38 years) and the impact alcoholism had on these characters is vividly and realistically drawn. Suspense keeps the reader moving fast through the twists in the narrative.,book
3307,"This book has no redeeming qualities. It's premise is silly and sophomoric. To have others call it ""Hitchcockian"" is insulting. Every character in the book is devoid of any thing approaching humanity. From the main characters to the secondary, from the good guys to the bad guys they are alike in that they are all  weak, whiny, disreputable and without any morals or ethics and so boorishly depicted that you simply cannot care about anyone in the story. You quite simply can only hope for a virus to come along early in the story and wipe out everyone involved. The virus would be more interesting and have more ""humanity"" than the people in this novel. If they make this into a movie I hope they add Ebola so I have someone to root for.",book
2188,"Poor alcoholic Rachel.  As she commutes daily on a train, heading towards a job she longer has, passing the same scenes daily, she creates a world of her own.  She fills it with characters that she assigns the perfect life, the perfect love.  Filling worthless, filled with longing for her ex husband and jealousy for his current wife and their new baby, she's witness to a murder.  Of course she's viewed with doubt.  After all she's an unreliable drunk who suffers blackouts and is obssessed with her ex husband's life. She sounds crazy and is viewed as such.  Twists and turns.  Some surprises.  I began to suspect who the murderer was half way through the book.  Still a good read that I kept going back to.  I felt real sorrow for Rachel.  Unable to move forward with her life, unable to admit that her past life is over, unable to decipher what memory is real and what is blurred by wine.  First time I have read htis aurthur.  I would read her again. Her characters are believable and I wanted to find out what happens to them",book
4917,"All is not what it appears to be.  The twists and turns in the lives of Rachel, Megan and Anna drew me in to the storyline.  Trying to decide among suspects and possible perpetrators made it a challenging read.  I found some repetition annoying, but possibly it was necessary to its conclusion.",book
4915,"Good grief!!  By the time I got to the end of this novel, I was thoroughly exhausted.  While the book provides interesting insights into the life of an alcoholic, and the lives of those around them, it failed to me to be a psychological thriller as touted. I wanted to shake the heroine and tell her to get a grip on her life.  For my money, the book could have been pages shorter.  I frankly was tired of riding the train by the time I got to the end of the book.  However, realization and coming to one's senses is always refreshing as is having another shot at life.  in this way, the book did indeed redeem itself.",book
2821,"Loved this book! A NY times best seller, it was entertaining and a good read.",book
2496,"It was a fine book. Had enough plot twists and red herrings to keep you interested and guessing. I was disappointing by the final plot twist as I was able to predict it since the second chapter.Written chapter by chapter in different view points, I was disappointed that the voices from each character had such little variation from one another.The main character was very well done as we are able to see her struggle and give an accurate depiction of the internal processes of alcoholism. However, I felt like some of the main characters were to inconsistent to be taken seriously and be believable.Over all its an acceptable thriller. I'm not sure if it's completely deserving of all the hype it's been receiving, but yeah. If you want to feel like you're up to date and part of a book fad, pick it up. It won't kill you.",book

When I finally realized that the order of events kept jumping forward and backward and from person to person, I figured it out (FINALLY!) Didn't mind reading chapters about each person, but the way the order of events was presented was not my favorite way to read a book. Other than that, I kind of liked it.....I think if I read it again, I will like it better!",book
2759,"Listened to this great murder mystery through Amazon Audible.  it was so compelling, I found myself sitting in the car to continue listening even after arriving at my destination.  There are three separate voices throughout the book, representing three main characters; each one different; they are woven together at the finish.",book

She is unemployed, drunk most of the time and can't get over her ex-husband, even though he cheated on her and eventually left her for the mistress. I don't want to say much more because I don't want to spoil anything. If you liked Gone Girl, I think you will like this book. I actually liked this book better than Gone Girl. Rachel is easy to sympathize with once you learn more of her backstory and I liked the end of this book better than Gone Girl also. If you are going to read this book make sure you have a few hours free because you are not going to want to stop reading until you finish.",book

No empathy nor sympathy with any of them.

3509,"After the initial confusion of WHO is doing the narration of each chapter (be sure to pay attention to the name at the top of each chapter), this book is a gripping tale that leads you on and teases you until you suspect nearly everyone of  possibly committing the unscrupulous deeds that evolve.

2469,"I was told this book was on par with ""Gone Girl,"" with which I strongly disagree. The plot was nowhere near as masterfully twisted. I wasn't pulling my hair out while reading this, lamenting how terrible it was... but I wouldn't say I particularly enjoyed it. The subject matter was kind of depressing (an alcoholic divorcee who cannot keep it together and another young woman who goes missing), and by the end, I kind of hated every one of the characters.",book

1948,"I thought it was an interesting premise and the characters' challenges  kept my attention.  I think some points were made and restated too many times.  Although the alcoholic blackout is integral to the plot, it is not a book about the perils of alcoholism, per say.  It does show the struggle to regain control and independence  following a series of unhappy events and relationships.",book
2026,"In the mood for a mystery, I dove into this pretty well-reviewed tale. Were it not for wanting to see if the killer was who I thought it was, I finished it. As a mystery, I found it wanting but, worse, as a story, it has an appalling number of shallow and seemingly stupid women. The men don't come off much better. One character, while na�ve, was recognizable, even appealing. Another, a practicing alcoholic was so excessive in her commitment to being drunk daily I could just about smell the liquor. A good mystery balances on credibility. I found this had none.",book
2682,"I was somewhat disappointed. Expected it to be like Gone Girl which I enjoyed immensely. The Girl on the Train was exciting up to a certain point. The technique of using three different voices wasn't very skillfully applied.  They all sounded the same. Same language, same way of thinking, which made the book a bit tedious. Good plot line though, although a bit contrived. A good easy read that doesn't stay long in memory.",book
2543,"I have heard the characters were all mental cases - yep to some degree they were.  A girl with a vivid imagination watched homes and the people who lived there from the train every day. Imagining their lives as stable, peaceful, loving, she couldn't have been further from the truth.  As an alcoholic, the girl became a different person when she drank too much, became involved in the lives of the people she watched from the train and almost lost her life because of that.  The surprise ending was handled very well by the author. I have a lot of responsibilities, so I am not one to read a book through at one sitting; therefore when I would have to take care of duties, my mind was constantly on the book, wondering, wondering - what next!  Good book and it would have been a real page turner if I had the ability to do that.  Really loved the way it was put together, with chapters on the main female characters. Really enlightened the understanding!",book

Doerr's exquisite novel  All the Light We Cannot See...which is on my top 10 forever list. It is unfathomable to determine the logic used to couple it with Doerr's masterpiece, but I assume this is why Hawkin's book has sold so well.There was not one character with whom to develop a  hopeful compassion (key ingredient) and draw you in intimately. I hung in and kept reading The Girl on the Train thinking Hawkins would somehow pull it off but alas...the depressing story  laid itself flat all the way to it's merciful conclusion.  Save your money. Pick up Lady in Gold and All the Light we Cannot see and sink into something you wish had no last page.",book

1494,"This book reads like a train:  beginning slowly without much fanfare, building speed as it rocks along, and then finishing full steam ahead to the conclusion. I was not sure I liked the main character--a good word to describe her would be ""loser.""  Yet as the book moved along, I found myself more and more drawn to her. This book is full of liars, and the surprising plot hinges on ""Whom do I believe?""  My opinion shifted throughout the book, and I wasn't sure of the truth-teller until the very end.  I can guarantee that the book will keep you engaged.  I look forward to more books from this author.",book
1413,"The story might have been interesting if I felt like any of the characters were likable or even described well. Very few of the characters, though speaking in first person, were realistically written. There was no real background to any of them; it was written like a fake, cheap romance novel, if you ask me. It felt as if everyone were distant in the story. By the end, I just wanted to get through it so I could say I finished and would be able to talk about it with my book club. I left feeling like I didn't care if anyone lived or died, not because I'm an uncompassionate person, but because the characters felt so unreal. Not good.",book

I finished it in the �wee smalls,� unable to put it down. What I really liked about it was that though I thought I�d figured out who the evil doer was at the very beginning, the author kept leading me astray � so that I abandoned my first impression only to be surprised at the end when I found that I was right from the start!The story is told from alternating points of view which I liked, too.The novel is dark and fast-paced, the characters are complex and the plot is compelling.

It started off at a relaxed pace, but before I knew it I sacrificed two days of my life to finding out what happened. I felt Rachel and her alcoholic blackouts were frustrating, but I had a lot of sympathy for her. Megan and Anna were harder. The unreliable narrator is a difficult thing to pull off--it takes a writer with a good amount of skill to pull it off effectively, and it's really, really well done here.",book
1646,"Good mystery, but slow in developing.  Could have used some better editing.  The first-person style of not just one character, but of the three main female characters made it hard to follow as their styles were similar.  Would have been better told in third person.  This might be a book that is better as a movie than as a book. In fact, with the limited geography, it could be done as a play.",book
1419,"I enjoyed this, and would probably give it more of a 3.5 star rating. While not perfect and not a favorite, it definitely kept me interested throughout, which is a crucial thing for me. I at least kept wanting to turn the page.However, I didn't find it that ""thrilling,"" which is unfortunate, because it is a thriller after all, and when I read from that genre, I expect the usual feeling of reading with bated breath. I didn't experience that with The Girl On The Train.Don't get me wrong, I thought it was intriguing and entertaining enough, and I do recommend this for others to try out for themselves, but for me, it just didn't blow my mind.",book
2492,A complicated story with multiple characters and time lines interwoven throughout.  The author does an excellent job of making the main character very annoying and unlikable while building to a somewhat predictable conclusion.  Older folks who have read and seen Hitchcock will catch on quickly.  Keeps you engaged!,book
1154,"I have put off reading this book for a long time because of all of the terrible reviews. When I saw the trailer for the movie, it looked good and I forced myself to read it. I just finished and I cannot for the life of me understand why this is getting such terrible reviews. I thought it was really good. Don't let the negative reviews deter you. One review says they're not likable characters. Based on the subject matter, I don't think these people were supposed to be likable. I don't think all characters have to have redeeming qualities necessarily, though I do think a couple in this book do.",book
3445,"The only reason I gave this book 4 stars and not 5, is only because the main character is really hard to root for.  She is a compulsive drinker and blacks out a lot.  Her black outs play into the story, it is just annoying as to how much she drinks.  Other than that, I felt the books was well written and very easy to get drawn into.  Heads up: The story takes place in and around London, so some of the vocabulary that was used is not normal words to Americans.  There wasn't a lot of British words, but wanted to make sure readers know.",book
3524,I liked the detail and imagery. I felt like I was right there with all the characters. The date switching was a little confusing I kept forgetting when it was... i recommend this for people who like a good mystery and suspense.,book
3972,"This book is slow to start and from the beginning you question why it was on the best seller list for so long.  The main characters are depressing and seem to never truly develop for the reader.  Although the last third of the book starts to pick up, it was not worth the wait.  Unless you have nothing else available, I would look for another book to read.",book

4890,"An interesting tale of a woman who sees her old neighborhood from a train which she rides daily.  She observes an occurrence that sparks her imagination and adds to her drinking problem.

The resolution is interesting and although not unexpected, not entirely foreseen either..",book
2897,I was excited to start this book but the excitement quickly changed to confusion and then disappointment.  I struggled through to the finish even though it took me several times of putting it down and then picking it up again.  Would I recommend it?  No.,book
2173,"Why oh why is this book on the best sellers list? Because of people like me who think the book will be good? It was compared to ""Gone girl"". Not so much. No twists in plot line. No characters that I remotely liked. I almost stopped reading the book a dozen times but kept thinking that it would get better because of the great reviews. Well I wasted my time. Very predictable, very boring. I am happy to be done with it.",book
2630,"A sad joke concerning those who are substance abusers asks ""How can you tell an addict is lying?"" Answer: ""His/her lips are moving."" Really not funny, but it supports a basic tenet of this book: every character is a liar. Most of the story is told from the point of view of a severe alcoholic, who looks into the homes of people whose houses are near the railroad tracks of the train she is on. She invents stories about their lives in between her drunken stupors. One day a murder occurs involving one of the people she watches; she decides to try to solve the murder on her own after lying to the police, making up her own story of what she believes happens. No spoiler alert here about what happens and who's involved. Suffice to say, the title of the book is a bit misleading: when I saw ""girl"", I thought the book would feature a young girl and her adventures on a train as it crosses the English countryside. Reading about a whino whose husband dumped her is not my cup of tea.",book
1389,"Fantastic! I binge read this on Kindle while listening to the Audible narration. I highly recommend getting both.  If you purchase the Kindle version, Amazon offers the Audible version to read along for under $8. The 3 women who narrate do an incredible job! They really bring the characters to life!  This is a very suspenseful book. It will keep you guessing until the end! Wonderfully written. I highly recommend this beat seller. You will not be disappointed!",book
979,"I really liked this book. I was skeptical that I would like it as much as I did, given how some reviewers compared it to Gone Girl, which I hated. There were some slow spots, and the main character's drunkenness got a bit tedious at times. However, the author did a great job building suspense. I was sure I knew the identity of the killer early on, but the twists and turns in the story made me realize my initial assumption was incorrect. Kudos for tricking me, even though I did figure it out before any of the characters <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>",book
1423,I really enjoyed the book! I decided to buy it to read on the plane on my way to Asia. I liked it! I almost left it behind because it was weighing my backpack down (LOL)! I actually enjoyed the story narration and it had a huge twist to it! It's not s***ty like Twilight and 50 shades (even though I read and loved all those books). It was eerie and kept me wondering what in the HECK is going on.I read online that there might be a movie in the works! We shall see if and how it will turn out! I like to read books before the movies come out to see the difference. I don't believe it will disappoint!,book
2706,"This started a little slow for me but I soon got into it. This is a psychological thriller and Hawkins is relentless as she makes the reader worry over the characters. Who is telling the truth? Whose memories are faulty. I read a couple of bad reviews of this book before I read it but heard so much hype I just had to find out for myself and am glad I did. The climax is one of the best I have read in a while. Rachel, the girl on the train will linger on with me for a while. Good stuff!",book
4952,"I thought this book was really lame until about halfway through because I couldn't understand the narrator's motivation and why the reader should care. But this turned out to be worth the read. It's suspenseful, i just spent the last hour and a half finishing this during work! I recommend.",book
1098,"The sort of thriller that mistakes frustration for suspense, it's a long series of red herrings, plot twists that turn into dead ends and impending climaxes that become just more delays to drag things out. The plot feels like the author made it up as she went along, which doesn't matter since it's really a platform for a lot of touchy-feely inner monologues by three different women who all sound exactly alike. Naturally they all come to the same realization that men are pigs and if women are crazy, you can bet it's some dude who made them that way.",book
189,"This has to be one of the worst books that I have ever read.  It lacks depth, has an under developed plot and characters, is confusing, jumps all over the place, and resembles something that an under performing 7th grader would write.  How it remains on the best seller continues to amaze me.  Very poorly written, a total waste of time to read, (but trust me, it will not take much of your time to read.)  I certainly hope America's interest is such a dime store calamity is not a reflection on the education of the American public.  Take a pass on this one.I've rated it one star which is one star more than it deserves.",book

4784,"I was surprised by how much I liked this novel. Very strange in the beginning, going back and forth. However, the more I read, the more I was pulled in. Scott was a complete jerk, but so was Megan. Rachel is just a poor lost soul. Anna, although I didn't like her, at least came through. The only character I felt was okay was the psychiatrist. Wouldn't really recommend",book
1398,"I started reading this book a few times and for some reason I just was not connecting.  I knew some day I would get back to it for I feel I have an obligation to finish a book once it is started.  Anyway the time was right and I finished the book and I am definitely glad I did. I struggled so with Rachel and her low self-esteem. I had such empathy for the young Megan and her loss and cheered Anna at the end for her bravery. I hope to read more from this author, Paula Hawkins.",book
1204,"Rachel, an obsessive alcoholic who has blackouts, is struggling with life after divorce and sinking further and further into oblivion.  She becomes involved in a missing person case that she witnesses from a train and the case gradually takes over her life.I was torn between giving this book five stars or one star.  Why?  Because, while it's clever, it was excruciatingly slow to get to the point.  It is told in the first person, in turns, by three women, all s-l-o-w-l-y painting a hazy picture of a puzzle that isn't explained until the very last pages. It was extremely frustrating and a few parts were borderline boring.However, I was fascinated by the author's stream-of-consciousness style even in the present tense, which I usually dislike.  There is virtually no dialogue for the first 30 pages, just rambling thoughts. The pace definitely picked up toward the end and got really exciting.  Then, I was hooked and couldn't turn the pages fast enough to discover the very satisfying conclusion.There is a very small cast of characters, none of whom are very likable, and yet the book held my interest throughout.  Something different.",book
857,"Yet another version of an inexplicably popular genre: poorly written books about awful people who do awful things to each other because they're too shallow and too bored to think of anything better to do with their time. Girl on the Train, Gold Finch, Gone Girl, Go Set a Watchman. Why do all these train wrecks start with the letter G? Not because they're good or worth your time to read. Why these books are sometimes grouped with Anthony Doerr's All the Light We Cannot See is beyond me, since Doerr always writes beautifully about worthwhile people and subjects. Kindle keeps recommending books like this for me, I guess because I keep reading them. Addicting, like the booze their protagonists often over consume. No worries, though. Tomorrow I'm going to quit.",book
779,"I found this highly touted book to be quite boring and frankly tedious.  The main character is wading through a quagmire of depression, delusion and gin and tonics in a can.  Most of the book takes place on a commuter train; the heroine is in an inebriated haze throughout.  As a psychologist I appreciate the difficulties of depression but this book does not handle the subject well.  All of the characters are hard to empathize with so one is left with ""no horse in the race"" to root for.  There are a couple of mild surprises but I seriously would not recommend this book to any of my friends.",book
4598,"It was a fast, easy read once you realized that the chapters were different characters viewpoint.  The publisher's heading the chapters with the names in such light type caused one to skip over them and created the confusion.  Seems to be a combination of Gone Girl and the true life situations in a couple of murders in the headlines in recent times.",book
4583,"I did enjoy the way the author wrote the book although I'd have to glance back at times to see who I was reading about. However, I must admit this was the first novel I've read in a long time where I did not like even one character.",book
2306,"Rachel Watson is the miserable poster woman for a Borderline Personality-disordered alcoholic who is depressed, anxious and has no redeemable qualities as a human being.  The premise itself is interesting; the point of view of the voyeuristic train passenger who imagines the lives of those living along the tracks of her daily commute.  Rachel finds herself in the middle of a mystery she feels compelled to participate in as a main character.  Just when you think her obnoxious and unreliable participation will actually contribute to something positive and meaningful - you are reminded that she is so shallow and self-serving that nothing good will come from her interference.  The other characters are equally as shallow and self-serving.  Although the book is very well-written and certainly interesting in it's telling, I couldn't help but be distracted by the fact that everyone was unlikable.  Ultimately, I was disappointed in the fact that Rachel never became a better person and we never learned the source of her sociopathic behavior. There was no one to root for  (not even the police) and in the end I am baffled as to why everyone was as deranged as they were.",book
918,"Great read for my cross country flight, it's a page turner or Kindle tapper to be more accurate. I doubt much of the story or characters will stay with me for long except for the alcoholic Rachel. As with any mystery if you figure it out too early on the rest becomes tedious. For me that was the case with this book and then suspense turned into impatience. But on the other hand if I hadn't been able to somewhat figure it out on my own I would have felt it was an ""unfair"" mystery so all good in the end!",book
3407,"This book kept me in suspense and I hated to put it down.  I enjoyed it very much.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  If I had to find any fault with this novel, I guess the fact that none of the main characters had outstanding moral fiber.  All three were somewhat flawed.  But aren't we all, or at least most of us , to some extent.  I liked the book because it was suspenseful, fast paced. and had a decent ending.",book
622,I could just never get into it.,book
2113,It certainly kept me on the edge of my seat and guessing about the outcome. My biggest problem with the book was a lack of empathy with the major character in the story. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery.,book

1161,"(2.5 stars) Highly overrated, less sophisticated version of Gone Girl:It was an easy read and I was intrigued by the premise of the plot, but this book is highly overrated. Most of the characters are so unlikeable and disingenuous, it's almost laughable. I truly didn't care what happened to any of the characters. The story lacked suspense and I feel like the answer to the mystery was obvious 2/3 of the way through. Overall, it reminded me of a less sophisticated Gone Girl. (I had mixed feelings about Gone Girl, but I appreciated the story's dark psychology and attention to detail).",book
3154,"It was a good start and it draws you in. My first thought was that it was a copy of the Gone Girl book- same tempo.  But by the middle of the book the characters are hard to relate to as the author, in pursuit of tension, keeps changing them from good to bad.  Oh, you thought this person was a good guy?  Well you were fooled, and now he's a bad guy.  It's a tactic you can use once but several times?  I got kind of bored with the back and forth and in the end you can't really relate to the characters anymore.  The lead character is kind of pathetic and starts to become tedious.  The ending is kind of ridiculous when the ""bad guy"" acts in a way I thought was not in keeping with the build-up of his character.  It is an ok beach read and some will probably like it but it's not a story you will remember after a few months.",book
4666,"I just finished reading this book as I savored it over several weeks.  Because each chapter alternates between characters, I sometimes found myself going back to the start of the chapter to remind myself which character it was I was reading about.I enjoyed how all the characters tied together as well as the outcome, which was not what I was expecting.  I really enjoyed the read!",book
4116,I found this book to be very captivating.  The author was able to take you into the mind of the characters as if you were living the story along with them.  It was very hard to put this book down once I get started.,book
2621,"Although the story was good, the writing was too wordy. Could have been just as interesting had she stopped going over the same thing all the time.",book
244,"It appears that I am in the minority, giving this novel 3 stars. Readers either love it or hate it. Which is fine, and is the  purpose of having reviews published. When you find reviewers who seem to like the same books you do, you're more inclined to consider other books they liked- that's all. No better, no worse, just different.So, on to the three star rating: This was a light summer read. I personally did not care for the author's style of writing nor how she presented the plot. There was too much focus, I thought, on how much and in what ways, Rachel got drunk, for example.  I got it. She's a raging alcoholic. No need to elaborate on each of the many incidents. And some of the events seemed just too unbelievable. As if someone could sneak into your home, drunk, take your baby while you sleep next to her, then run outside with her and not wind up in jail on attempted kidnapping charges!In addition, I wasn't crazy about the author's style of writing. If you haven't read the novel: each chapter is presented from the point of view of one of the 3 female characters, written in the first person. I began to notice that each started to sound like the others; same way of speaking, even the same expressions, at times. I found it difficult to differentiate among them, since they sounded the same. And since they are all deeply flawed, they needed more character development in order for the reader to find something redeemable about any of them. The reader needs something to hang on to- empathy, sympathy, relate ability- in order to care about a character. I didn't find this to be the case.Perhaps some of my disappointment here lies in the fact that I had just finished All The Light We Cannot See. Beautifully written and developed. Talk about caring for the characters... wow.I am not sorry that I read the book. It is a quick, somewhat entertaining read. Not something you have to dedicate part of your life to. And I can see why it has its share of devoted fans. Even if I am not among them.",book
3285,"My book club all agreed that the book was well written for a first novel.  The suspense was there, and I think finally being able to determine the murderer in the last few pages was a plus as the reader waited to see just what would become of that character along with possible victims. We also agreed that the author had done a fine job of making us ""not"" like any of the characters.  In this book, that was a good thing.",book
721,"A cleverly constructed story written from the perspectives of the three main female characters, Rachael, Megan, and Anna.  Rather than numerical chapters, each chapter is named for whomever happens to be telling the story from their point of view at the time.  This transforms into a gripping and exciting yarn about love found, then tragically lost.  It touches upon the insidious and hopeless consequences of alcoholism, infidelity, and ultimately cold and calculated murder.  This is not a happy story with a fairytale ending.  It left me feeling glad it was over but satisfied I stayed with it.",book
1349,"Absolutely riveting.  Could not put it down.Having just returned from Paris where I was ""the woman on the train"" I found the story plausible and quite engaging, as well as entertaining.Lovely, engaging characters coupled with the authors fluid writing made this something I couldn't stop reading until I was finished with the book!!",book
1052,"I felt this book dragged for the first 250 pages.  It basically dealt with Rachel's alcoholism, driving her ex-husband crazy and her involvement as an alcoholic in Megan's disappearance.  It was over the top.  The only character who seemed halfway normal was Anna.  As one reviewer said, ""Why did Hawkins put the man with the red hair in the book?""  I have no idea either.  I usually give great ratings, but I can't do it for The Girl on the Train ... it was just okay.  It's no Gone Girl, that's for sure.",book
2448,"I loved how the story was told through 3 characters eyes. It was suspenseful,and at times had you rooting for and against the characters.",book
1482,"I didn't like this book on several levels.  None of the three main female characters were in the least likeable--all unemployed self absorbed whiners; by mid-book I was hoping they would all be victims of a serial killer.  After the murderer is revealed, it's (I won't say he or she) character is somewhat hamhandedly portrayed.  I finished it by skimming through a lot of the tedious dialogue.  Can't believe there's talk of making it into a movie.  I did like the premise of the voyeuristic train ride, but that's about it.",book
4699,"Confusing at first, but one has to examine the date and narrator at the head of each chapter, and keep the participants and relationship in mind.  PS:  The movie does an excellent job of capturing the story in 90 minutes!",book
4998,"I can't really see why this is a best seller.  A lot of it just dragged.  Way too many drunken blackouts.  Every character is totally dysfunctional, except for the baby.  The book is just over the top with needy, sick people.  I wouldn't recommend it.  At least I know what all the hype is about; I just don't think the book is worth the hype.",book

1565,"finished reading this book after I had heard it was going to be made into a movie.  Originally started three months ago, but stopped because I really did not enjoy reading about an alcoholic.  Then I thought maybe it would get better as I read further.  It did not.  Not like Gone Girl despite some comparisons.  Finished only because I forced myself.",book
2373,"I don't know why everyone thinks this book is so great! After months of hearing how smashing this book is, I finally bought it and was bitterly disappointed. The main character is a jerk. Not because she's an alcoholic, I have compassion for that, it's because she's really unlikeable. I hated this book. My husband got 25 pages in and deleted it, he disliked it more than I did.",book
3121,The strong voices of the characters kept me hooked to this book.  Quick read but I felt the depth of details kept the book moving forward at a slow walk to the long awaited finality of Megan's death at the end of the book.  A bit predictable but loved it nonetheless.  Felt the tone to be similar to books like Gone Girl.  I would highly recommended.,book
4169,"This book was not as good as I had been led to believe that it would be. It's narrated by three different people and at first, it's hard to understand who they are and who's talking about what. It was very confusing until the characters were all straightened out. The names of the narrators should be in a darker font, as well, because it is easy to miss the names on the Kindle as you are reading.",book
939,"I absolutely loved this book. I have heard it being compared to Gillian Flynn's works, and I guess I see a slight similarity, but Hawkins did a great job of setting her own tone & pace. It's painful reading from the main character's perspective sometimes because she is just so screwed up, but the book itself was a great read. Enough twists and turns to keep me on my toes, and only a tiny bit predictable on occasion.I have said this to everyone I've recommended it to: The main character's room mate is the unsung hero of the book. What she deals with... pffft. I don't think I know anyone who would tolerate their room mate to act the way the main character does.",book
4941,"This book was a bit hard to follow at first and seemed scattered for a while. About a third of the way into the book one begins to get a handle on what is going on and it does get quite intriguing as you continue reading.  The characters are all very unlikable, not one with any redeeming quality.  I wouldn't say I loved this book, but it was worth finishing.",book
4296,A real page turner. Reads fast. Very entertaining. Each chapter the point of view of a difference  character. Hawkin hits a home run with a first time novel. Be interesting to see what she comes up with next.,book
1364,I had to restart this book twice and almost put it down.  You need to get a little over 10 percent in to get past the lulling roll of the train and into the action.  It becomes a search for lost memories and a lesson in the perils of alcohol and/or self-deception. A Marple of red herrings.  It is engrossing once the story starts and I finished the rest in a single day.  I gave it 3 stars because of the slow start - which I admit may be more punishment than rehabilitation - and the fact that it was seemed derivative and more than a bit precious.  Still it was a good genre read and I recommend it to you.,book
2693,"Apart from the baby, or it's hard to find a sympathetic or interesting character.  Even the setting is gritty and depressing. Finally, there is a resolution of sorts, and the plot is over. There is no real satisfaction at the outcome, no explanation of behaviours, and no desire to meet the characters nor setting in a sequel.",book
1909,"While I don't particularly like a diary format to a novel, this allowed the reader to be able to see the different points of view of the major characters. The main character had to work out her own issues with depression and alcoholism to be able to attempt a normal life. Her imagery of the people's lives outside the train lent for an interesting murder mystery, all the way to the end.",book
1357,Good book. Read it in a day. A similar read to Gone Girl so if you like that type of thriller this is the book to read! The chapters are told from first person by character (the three women characters). The only thing I'd would say about it is the date changes on the chapters made it hard to follow at first- mainly because I didn't realize one voice stayed in one date range and the other voices where in another date range. But once you get the hang of it it becomes a good read. Definitely recommend!,book
2633,"My lack lustre review may stem from my gender bias that I wanted stronger coping skills from the heroines far earlier. Too much contrivance and too many weak characters for me,  but it may have more resonance with the female millennial set.  I think I will like the movie better, because the viewing public will want a stronger, less drunk Rachel.",book
312,"The Girl on the Train is the perfect thriller to read on a trip--it's quick and easy to read, it's intriguing, and it keeps you guessing.I have to say, Hawkins has done a great job at creating a slew of characters to dislike. I don't mean that as a bad thing, though. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a book where I felt like I was my own detective, trying to solve a mystery where I couldn't even trust the narrators. There was some type of a plot twist around every corner, and in the end, I was very much satisfied by the climax and conclusion Hawkins created. (I'll add a quick caveat here that there was one part of the story towards the end about one of the character's backgrounds that is so quickly explained, that it felt like an afterthought thrown in for necessity, but not development--that was disappointing).The only major complaint I had about this book was that so much of it felt unoriginal and cliche to me. The characters were somewhat dull: Rachel is an alcoholic, Megan is a restless obsessive, and Anna is a narcissist. But very little of each of these character's traits were developed further. And the men in this book were so black-and-white that I sort of pity any man who reads this book because the stereotypes are so plain to see--the men are either doting, kind-hearted lovers or oppressive, jealous villains.But then again, maybe these cliches were exactly Hawkins point--to make the setting and characters so ordinary that it made the story just that more chilling.",book
2393,"Bought this book for my daughter to read on the plane on her way to vacation in Puerto Rico.  She loved it!!  Read it on the plane, beach and every quite moment she had.  Came home raving as much about the book as she did about the trip!  Great book!  She passed it on to a friend and already has plans to see the movie this summer.  Although she was disappointed that the casting of the movie didm't fit how she imagined the characters (but what else is new!)  still a Great Book!  Get it!",book
1439,"Overall I enjoyed this book and read it in two days during the Jonas Blizzard.  It started slowly, but once it got going, it made for a good mystery and suspense story.  I would recommend this book for anyone who enjoys mystery novels, though this book is different in that the heroine is a mess and not entirely relatable (low self-esteem, alcoholic, unemployed).",book
2659,"I really enjoyed this book.  The characters evolved throughout the story. I found myself despising Rachel, then feeling sorry for her and finally admiring and cheering for her.  The mystery unfolds slowly and kept me guessing until end.  A very good read",book
2257,"There is a reason this is a bestseller. I read the book in anticipation of sometime catching the movie, as I think Emily Hunt is the bees knees ;-) This plot is inventive and where it isn't, it exudes a fresh perspective. If you like psychological suspense, I recommend. (But let's face it, I'm waaay behind the curve on this one!)",book
3848,"This was a pretty good read. It was well-written, and suspenseful--it definitely held my attention. It was pretty heavy, though. It deals with alcoholism, domestic violence, murder. Generally it left me feeling pretty sad. Not my best choice of books to read on the beach.",book
247,"I did enjoy this book -- it's a quick read and the plot does hold one's attention. It's also refreshing to have a narrator (there are several, but Rachel seems to be the primary one) who is not especially likable; it's a change of pace from the norm.But there were a lot of things about ""The Girl on the Train"" that nagged at me. Yes, it's a thriller, but it went deeper and deeper into implausibility as it proceeded, and I felt like the whole thing could have been wrapped up 50 pages sooner. Rachel's decline, while realistic, also strains credulity a bit -- I will not spoil things, but I felt the supporting characters would not have let her go so far.I would give the book four stars but for one key failing: Every woman in this book is defined entirely by her relationship with men. Being in relationships, being mothers, being loved and ""cared for"" -- that's all that seems to matter to them. (And the men are boorish, smug cads.) One might not seek complexity in a book like this, but I was surprised by the misogyny.",book
81,"I agree with some other reviewers. The characters in this novel were all annoying and not believable.  The main character, Rachel, you just want to reach out and smack some sense into her.  I just keep reading so I could be done with it. It is one crazy female after another, surrounded by awful men. I fail to see why this book is getting so many good reviews. Stay away.",book
4741,"Loved book. Can't wait for movie, but understand that it is America not London. Looks like from tidbits it's a big White House she is looking at, don't know if I will like that either. Will make judgment after I see the movie.",book
3905,"This is a constantly evolving story which is why it keeps you reading. In fact, it was very hard to put this book down. It starts off seeming like the story of a woman who happily lives vicariously through others. Then it evolves into a story about relationships and how hard it is to let it go when it ends and then evolves yet again into a murder mystery.  And that's just from the point of view of the main protagonist. It's written from the point of view of 3 different women which gives it wonderful texture.  It also provides wonderful twists and turns.  I didn't see the ending coming. It's an excellent read that I'd recommend to anyone.",book
4212,"Great plot twists and turns. I couldn't stop reading!  I was impressed with the storytelling of each person throughout the book; and, how it all came together in the end. I'm afraid to see the movie, because I'm sure the book is best!",book
3728,"Overall, I really liked this book and understand all of its praise. I did, however, find myself slogging through the middle where it seemed to get repetitive. It was easy to get into the characters and the story and for the first 1/3 I was riveted. I got through a few slow parts and then felt that it all came together well in the end. Nice writing and a great story.",book
1617,"I'm guessing the author's goal was to write a book that was ugly and  filled with depraved characters since that is what's so popular now -- and that goal was met.  After reading this book, I felt like I needed a hot, soapy bath for my brain.  If you want to read a filthy book that has little suspense and no true heroes then this is for you.",book
3598,"Though the book, like a train, took a bit to get up to speed, I really liked where Paula went with this.  I found myself becoming attached to the 3 main characters and loved how their stories unfolded. The read is pretty simple, yet very enjoyable.",book
1851,"I'm really surprised I didn't love this book. I started it on a flight home, basically highlighting every other quote, wanting to stay up all night after my late night flight and read more. Then somewhere towards 60% (Kindle reader) I realized that I wasn't enjoying the story, but just trying to get to the end. Boo. I wish I enjoyed reading it more, all of the hype around the book had me anticipating to do so. I think Hawkins writing is about average, her character development is above average. The story is interesting, it just didn't hold me after grabbing me, I guess.",book
686,"This book was a quick read, it pulled me in almost immediately and did not let me go until I finished. There is a feeling of nostalgia throughout the novel that gives you the feeling that you are talking to an old friend you haven't seen in awhile, one who saw you through some difficult times. I am not the best person to review mystery novels because I usually guess who did it before the big reveal. However, I thought the author did a pretty good job of making you doubt what you thought (although she did so by painting every male character as menacing). The main character, Rachel, is pretty sad. You immediately feel bad for her and as you delve further into the story you realize just how pathetic she is. None of the characters are particularly happy or well-rounded people, the women in this story lead especially depressing lives.",book
4185,"Once I figured out that the story was being told by more than one person, I got very into the book and ended up staying up till 5 a.m. to finish it.  It was very exciting and certainly kept me guessing.",book
2517,"A good read, but a bit confusing going back and forth among the characters. Read it at a busy time, so I would start and stop. Would have been a better if I had read the book without so many interruptions. Several of my friends have put it aside as they couldn't ""get into it"". Looking over the plot, I think it is a good story.",book
2606,"One of the weirdest mysteries I have ever read, and one of the best. Told from the perspectives of 3 women, this story weaves and warps as it goes along with a surprise around the turn and then another surprise. Very visual. And sometimes you may think you are losing your mind. I think the author intends these thoughts on the part of the reader. Shape shifting, ""now wait a minute"" moments, ''did I miss something?"" thoughts and then it comes together into an amazing whole. I loved it!",book
1215,Great mystery with an interesting story line. Rachel appears to be an unusual character initially but then as the story developsone realises that she is a product of her life experiences.This book was chosen for our book club and everyone spoke positively about it and enjoyed the good read.,book
3405,Saw this was a best seller.  So I was drawn in.  Just shows what marketing and New York Times can do.  Characters were all pathetic.,book
3515,I was looking forward to reading this story from other reviews and it has definitely lived up to the great ones !  Kept me in suspense the whole story.  It did get a little repetitive in the middle but once it reached the end it all made sense as to why.  Great summer read if you love suspenseful stories!,book
4722,I was led to this book by the buzz of the ladies at the book club and the new movie trailer. Good story but it did drag a bit in the beginning. The twist at the end was not as shocking if you paid attention to the bread crumbs.  Solid reading.,book
3952,"Not that big a deal. Story felt like it could have been 10,000 or 20,000 words shorter. Too much of it felt like s t r e t c h i n g.Characters just fumbling around in a deliberately unclear story felt annoying to me.Depressed drunk stumbling around in unclear memories just got irritating.Best part of the story was trying figure out the various possible story lines, possible ways it would play out.The ending is one of the endings that will occur to you.-To be honest it's a mystery to me why this book is so popular.",book
4289,"I love an unreliable narrator done well. Rachel even knows she's unreliable--she's an alcoholic who experiences blackouts. People tell her some of what she's missed, and she retains feelings and impressions; but are either real? For that matter, how reliable are the other narrators? The sort of mystery that kept me guessing till the end.",book
4613,"The story itself did not match up to the write up about it. It was lackluster, I did not identify with the main protagonist who maintains an alcoholic stupor pretty much throughout the story. The ending was just awful. If I wanted to suspend reality throughout the entire book I would read fantasy or sci fi, not fiction.Don't waste your money!",book
454,The main character was an alcoholic and  consequently she couldn't remember or justify her behavior.  Plot was confusing and weak.,book
1244,"A great and easy read to get wrapped into.If you have a blizzard taking over your Saturday and the only thing on TV is apocalyptic new reports then I highly suggest downloading this book and jumping in. It was fun from start to finish. My only reason for not ratting this book higher was that it really begins to slow down in the final 100 pages. I was starting to get anxious that the book would end before the plot wrapped up. Finally in about the last 50 pages it all comes at you so fast that you're left thinking, "" what! that's all!!?""",book
1758,"Overall, I enjoyed reading this novel, but I'm not sure I understand the overwhelmingly excellent reviews.  This book is nothing  close to Gone Girl, and shouldn't be compared to Flynn.  I wanted to know how it ended and I was compelled to keep reading to find out. As a debut novel, I am definitely still interested in seeing what comes next.Unfortunately, there is room for improvement. In my opinion, there wasn't a lot of character development, which may have been by design as part of the mystery. but in the end, I didn't really care what happened to the characters",book
2611,"This book is completely captivating.  Once you start reading, clear your schedule because you're not going to do anything else until you finish.  Movie is also great.",book
4513,"II can only rate what I read as I did not complete the book.  Personally, I thought itwas difficult to follow.  The characters were always vague and strange - hard to know who was who - what was realand what wasn't.  A dreamlike book - i prefer more down to earth characters and realistic circumstances.  .",book
2919,So glad I got a chance to read this. I was hooked in the first 3 paragraphs. I can actually say I did not see the end coming until the book was nearly done.,book
600,"What I loved about the book was the concept. How many times have you driven past the same houses, same people, and imagined what their lives would be like? The story begins as a daily commuter, Rachael, who struggles with alcoholism, watches a loving couple from the train...(Jess and Jessie) she's chosen them, their house, because it is directly down the street from her ex-husband and his new wife - the woman he left her for....The storyteller has created quite a loving life for this mystery couple; an artist and a doctor!! Then one day, from her seat on the train, Rachel  witnesses what she believes to be adultery...Cursed with drunken blackout's, curiosity and just bad luck, Rachel awakes one morning, covered in blood, wounds on her body, with no recollection of how she got in this predicament...Rachel finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation...and possibly intimate with the murderer. Interesting, quick read.",book
2911,"I didn't like this book.  The story is so sad, about a divorced woman's life, and what her memories and a chance view of her former neighborhood did to cause what ensued.  The relationships described are unpleasant and unlikely, unless all those soap operas are true after all.  Some of the characters are well-defined and interesting.",book
4594,"The idea of a woman observing life from a train window is an interesting concept. When the story is being told from this vantage point, it remains  riveting. However, when the main character is off the train...whether in town or in her apartment... she emerges as unlikeable and foolish and in need of an intervention.  The other voices in alternating chapters add to understanding the whole story. All in all, it was a good book and the author kept me guessing until the end.",book
2227,"I liked it that Ms. Hawkins was able to pace the novel in the same way that the Train in the title moved - starting fast, slowing down along the way, but then picking up speed.  The middle of the novel was incredibly slow for me, but it accelerated in the end.  I also understand why all the main women characters were somewhat similar and all the main men characters were similar - kept us guessing who the killer was, but I kept getting them mixed up, especially since the points of view changed with each chapter.",book
492,"I'd looked at this title and read the blurb many times before I relented and bought the book.  I think I've been reading too much to know the difference between good writing and bad.  While the pride flowed well in this book it was often times confusing.  Jumping between dates, Megan, Rachel, and Anna, I often find myself flipping back pages to see if what I was reading happened before or after doomsday.  Then when I got about 75% done, the bad guy became blatantly obvious.  No real physiological twist there.  I guess this is a good book.  It spent too many weeks on the NYT bestseller list to not be, right?  And it's already been optioned for a movie.  Have readers in general just gotten easier to please?",book
3704,"Confusing at first, but one has to examine the date and narrator at the head of each chapter, and keep the participants and relationship in mind.  PS:  The movie does an excellent job of capturing the story in 90 minutes!",book
3281,"Books do not come any better than Girl on the Train. The plotting, the pacing, the characters, all of it, flawless. I was hooked from page one, read it practically in one sitting, and I see why so many people love it. Like Stephen King said, Hawkins nails that alcoholic narrator and uses the device to perfection. GOTT, like Gone Girl before it, is a perfect blend of literary and popcorn thriller. Simply put: a masterpiece.",book
4766,Must read.  So glad a friend suggested it. Helpful Hint:  Keep reading until midway through the book--& then you will NOT want to put it down until the end.  Looking forward to seeing the film--but so glad I read it first!,book
635,"The Girl on the Train should not be read on my Kindle.  The chapter headings, providing an orientation to who is narrating and when, are indispensable to following the book, and in my case the essential information was illegible--or maybe I didn't pay attention, until  it was too late.  Also, don't attempt to read this book in fits and starts.  It will be frustrating to figure out who's narrating and when.  There are several narrators, and at least one is unreliable.  None are interesting.I wish writers would notice that drug and alcohol problems have already been written about very comprehensively.  I really am sick of the vomit on the carpet genre.  This books devotes way too much to attention to describing the perils of drinking.I guess the structure and characters are meant to create suspense and mystery, but I found instead confusion and tediousness.",book
515,"I really wanted to give this book 5 stars, but the only thing holding me back was that I thought that the ending wasn't as detailed as the rest of the book and felt a little rushed. However, it didn't detract from the story and the story was fabulous in every way!  It took me about 3 or 4 chapters to get my head around who the main character was. It would have been helpful to have a little notebook handy and write down which character and date I was reading as the chapters jump back and forth a bit just as they did in Gone Girl and initially I found it difficult to follow but it is well worth persevering. Rachel, the main character is fascinating to follow as she embeds herself in the lives of others and tackles her own issues at the same time. I started to determine the answers to the mystery about halfway through and was pretty sure about it at about the three quarter mark. I would have liked the story to have given a bit more detail around the character of Megan as it would have been nice to see what made her tick also. Overall, a great and entertaining story. I would recommend reading if you like a psychological drama/thriller.",book
1231,"It was really hard to get into this at first. However after ploughing through the initial 30 pages or so it got interesting. I can't say that it totally surprised me and blew me away but, it did keep me locked in wanting to know how it all ends. Will I read this again? Maybe not. Once is good enough. Would I recommend it? Sure! It's definitely a good read.",book
265,"In a nutshell: it was ok.Let me start by briefly explaining why I chose this book. Everyone seemed to be raving about it. Even NYPL! So, as usual.. I thought: I need thisin my life! I had (unfortunately) high expectations about this book and I didn't even bother to read what was it about. I read that it was similarto Gone Girl, I even quote: ""�The Girl on the Train has more fun with unreliable narration than any chiller since Gone Girl. . . . [It] is liable to draw a large, bedazzled readership.��The New York Times"".In my opinion, it is just an ok book. I still have my doubts if it is a cleverly plotted thriller. Paula Hawkings indeed tried to present compelling characters,but to me, they were a bit too predictable and in some cases, annoying. Now, it alternates between three points of view (all females), and to me, tends to fall to unnecessary (not always, but in this case) and gimmicky. Basically the whole mystery is a mess right up until the last chapters, where you get a grip of the situation. The ending for me was extremely melodramatic, and I thought for a minute I just read a Hollywood movie. Very few real twists, first chapters are monotonous. Plain and simple: just mediocre.While on Gone Girl we saw how the author fought back against female cliches of the accommodating victim or love interest with a cold, calculating villain, The Girl on the Train takes a less defiant angle. The main character: Rachel is delivered through an unwittingly unreliable narration to evoke the aftershocks of abuse and trauma. Do I think this was a powerful way of exploring women's marginalization? Not entirely. I am not 100% convinced. I did not like any of the characters, and to be quite honest, the male roles were a bit stereotyped (that is just my impression). I do not get what is the hype about this book? It isn't a bad one, but surely not a master piece either! It is a bit depressing even?Conclusion:*It is an ok book, touching the limits with mediocre? Take this book for your summer holidays at the most. Do not expect a deep, fascinating suspense book.*Boring, a little bit depressing? At the end picks up the pace and you feel more hooked.*Complex but a bit predictable characters.*Easy to read!",book
2243,"A nail bitter that makes you want to stay up all night to finish.  I loved the shifting character perspectives.  It helped to maintain the suspense, while slowly revealing bits of info that constantly made you question your assumptions about the characters.  I found the characters to be real and compelling, especially the protagonist, Rachel.  Definitely a good read.",book
3257,It took me a long while to get into the story but then bam all of a sudden couldn't put it down until it was finished.  Great book has your mind twisting and turning.  Glad I read the book and did not go see the movie.  Excellent.,book
191,Like a UK Gone Girl. Only different.A valid example of why we shouldn't booze it up.And perhaps a bit of why we should.,book
4642,"Mixed bag. A page turner at times and at other times tempted to quit.  All characters are shallow and unlikable.  They all deserved each other. I read to find out it 'who did it' but the writer was not fair with the details.  Sad, lonely, pained, lying, helpless, hopeless men and women.  Not one ounce of happiness or joy. Story was  too depressing, I wished I skipped it.",book
1249,"Perhaps I could complain that the story started off slowly, but really, the only complaint I have is that I've never read anything by Paula Hawkins before. Her character portrayals are spot on and the simple complexity of the story kept me (metaphorically) turning pages at an ever increasing rate. Ultimately I found myself admiring the bravery of a woman I felt contemptuous of merely pages before. The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that one character just seemed ""off"" to me; not really believable, although I wanted to.....Read it! Of course, you've already it. There's no surprise why this book has been on the best seller lists. It's just so good.",book
953,"This debut novel is told via three first-person narrators, all female, one of whom is the title character.  I found Rachel, the alcoholic title character, sufficiently complex and believable; though her excessive drinking makes her somewhat contemptible, it also makes her human, and I was able to empathize with her.  (Rachel's drinking is a necessary plot element, as it prevents her from remembering critical events.)  What makes this a less impressive novel than ""Gone Girl"" is the novel's narration.  One narrator is somehow able to recount for readers what is happening to her as she dies.  The mystery surrounding her death is, however, suspenseful enough to make the novel an interesting read.",book
3071,The suspenseful narrative kept you guessing up until the end.  Wanted to read book before seeing movie in order to compare the written characters with the acting ones.  I'm hoping the screenplay will capture the characters as the author portrayed them so lifelike in the novel. Entertaining reading,book
1331,"First off, I think there is somewhat of a ""herd"" mentality in the overall negative ratings by some reviewers of this book. With that off my mind...I see real value in the epiphanies each of the three female characters experienced within the unfolding of the story.Rachel literally rides the train and, to my interpretation, is  also, figuratively riding the train of alcoholism leading to some serious self delusion. She blames the failure of her marriage entirely on herself and carries the burden of the resultant guilt. She never saw her husband clearly. While riding the train into London everyday she invests emotional attachment to a young couple she observes in a house she passes everyday...so much so... she bestows upon them her own made-up names. Events in her own life and in the lives she is observing conspire to literally and figuratively make her get off the train. These events are suspenseful and make for a great storyline. Both Anna and Megan each have different self discoveries. The male characters do not seem to evolve and if anything, each one you meet shares culpability in the main event of the book.  Particularly odious to me (and he is written to actually smell bad) is Scott for his hyper aggressive selfish character; his bullying and his assault of Rachel. Just a personal observation and opinion.Careful reading of this book will yield many clever literary devices. The fact that there is not one smile described as genuine from joy at its root in the whole book.""Everything about him is warm�his hands, his eyes, his voice�everything but the smile. You can see the killer in him when he shows his teeth.""Another is the symbolism behind the small pile of rocks in the corner of Megan and Scott's garden.It is not written as an intense suspense narrative with accelerated pacing and should not be compared with such.  It is written more like a jigsaw puzzle with the pieces to the puzzle locked inside the seemingly blackout mind of the ""Girl on the Train"".  For a satisfying literary and emotional experience and challenge, I highly recommend this book.",book
194,Excellent thriller. Unexpected final. One of the best books I have ever read. An amazing narrative...I felt every single moment. A must read book...!!!,book

2018,"Not exactly great ""literature"" but once you make it through the slow beginning it opens with, you are along for the ride of a woman who thinks of herself as an alcoholic loser who bumbles into a mystery that she can't let it go.  I highly recommend this book for good old fashioned escapism and entertainment. You will find yourself rooting for this appealing, loser as she tells the story that unfolds in present time, first person narrative.",book
1704,"This book was so depressing in the beginning that I thought, really? This is what everyone likes? Thankfully, I kept reading, and realized why everyone likes it. I like multiple POV's almost always - shifting timelines, I like less, and in this case it was a little confusing, but worked well in the end. Very suspenseful. 4 stars instead of 5 because of the depression factor (which was really only there in the first 25% or so), but mostly because the timelines kept confusing me. That aside, enjoyed this book all the way through and now I want to un-read it so I can read it again for the first time.",book
2294,"This book was great! I will admit, it took some time to get into it. I encourage those starting this book to KEEP WITH IT!

4153,"This was not worth the time, even though it was so easy to read it didn't take up too much. The characters aren't likable in any way, just pathetic and badly behaved. The murder mystery aspect is so drawn out as to make it a chore to get through, instead of captivating & thrilling. It was unoriginal, the writing was just okay, and the characters sucked.",book

3044,Once I got use to the different characters going back and forth I did really well.  It was a thrill and a great mystery.  It kept you in suspense until the end.

I can not wait for the movie to come out!!,book
633,"I was a little slow on the uptake realizing there were three different characters telling their stories. Once I got a clue I followed the story line better. The three stories are dated on each of their chapters, but unless you are compulsive about noting the dates, it's a little hard to follow where you are in the action in terms of the time line. Ultimately it comes together and the time line becomes less important.Altogether though, I think it was a well constructed story, interesting to follow. The most interesting character was struggling with alcoholism and I believe the portrayal by the author was very on target and fascinating to follow.Aspects of it make it not-such-an-easy read, but it certainly makes you think, and that's ok too.Generally well done - I would read another by this author.",book
2203,"This book was pretty predictable, and honestly, I didn't really get the point of the confrontation between the husband of the woman and Rachel.  It never seemed like we got a resolution as to why he was so angry with her to the point of trapping her.  The ending was pretty blah, and I feel like this was just a great value brand of Gone Girl, which was pretty popular.",book
358,Great read!,book
103,"I was blown away by this psychological thriller, a debut psychological thriller at that! I was fascinated by the idea of this woman secretly spying on residents everyday as she rides the 8:04 train. People watching is fun, I enjoy doing it when I�m forced to be social, but the situation this woman involves herself in is far more complicated, and personal, than she expected. (And something I�m not motivated enough to involve myself with- bye Felicia.)Coming out of a rough divorce, Rachel finds herself at an all time low. She drinks to dull her emotional pain, she rides the train into town without a sense or purpose, and now she finds herself meddling in other�s peoples affairs- literally. As a former resident of Blenheim Road, she�s always watching as she passes by... Until one day, she sees something, within the blink of an eye, that kick starts an investigation she�s stuck in the middle of.Rachel begins her own personal investigation after the police have made it quite clear they won�t be listening to an unstable drunk. The case had me jumping to conclusions after each chapter. I wanted answers and wanted them now. I was desperate to read faster, to unlock another clue that would lead me in the right direction of solving the mystery.Hawkins wrote chapters from alternating points of view, revealing pertinent bits of information at the right moment. The minute I had an inkling on who the perpetrator could have been, something new was thrown into the equation and I�d be back to square one. Mad props on your trickster ways and skills, Paula.One of my favorite things about reading this genre is trying to figure out/solve the mystery before it�s revealed. (Movies, too!) It�s a trait I inherited from my dad. Books I can�t figure out/solve are always enjoyable; whether I�m reading and frantically turning pages as if they�re more important than air, or taking my time to absorb the details and take notes, they engulf me. Sleep is for the weak, I need answers.The Girl on the Train was a nail biter and I was hooked on the story the entire time. I look forward to future works by this author!",book

4036,Mediocre. I read this out of curiosity and was highly disappointed. Yes it'seems similar to Gone Girl in the sense that it's a mystery story and all the characters are terrible  people but the similarities end there. Not remotely as exciting.,book
2164,"This was a book I could not put down.That being said, in some ways, many ways in fact, it reminded me too much of Gone Girl.Perhaps this is the London version of Gone Girl.Girl on the Train is fast-paced, riveting and engrossing.I could not feel any sympathy for any of the characters. Rachel was a victim of her own habits, clumsy, dull, needy and relentlessly foolish in her behavior. I simply wanted to shake her and tell her to leave well enough alone, but then of course there would be no story, no conflict.Anna and Megan were shallow, greedy and wanting and taking what wasn't rightfully theirs to take. Megan's wanton nature did her in. Hers was a sad little life that might have turned out better if she had made better choices.Anna's life was a full circle, ""what goes around comes around"" tale.And the men were despicable brutish abusers!Seldom have I disliked so many characters in a novel!I did enjoy the book, but compared to Gone Girl it was a bit disappointing. It was written in the same style.. First one character's narrative, then another's, but the adversaries in Gone Girl were clearly more clever,  more attractive and even more resourceful.Though there were twists and turns, Girl on the Train was plodding in places and I really don't care what Rachel does next!",book
1425,"I wanted so much to like the characters,  but found myself scoffing through much of this book.  They are all self absorbed, pathetic and just plain boring. I could not like, nor feel sorry for any of them.  Rachel drove me crazy with the mess she continued to make of her life.  Anna was a sorry excuse for a wife and mother.  Each and every character was dis-likable in their own way and I got tired of the phony dramas in their lives.  I could not wait to get this book over with and the only reason I stuck with it was to prove that I figured out ""who did it"" by mid book.  I was right by the way.  Why on earth the high ratings - I will never know.",book

It took me a while to get into her character because she does make so many bad decisions - it was hard for me to relate to her. You also need to pay attention to the chapters and the date for each chapter - the chronology is very important in the story line.",book

4625,"The first third of the book I found ponderous, so I ended up skimming until things started going a little faster.

2293,"The plot was intriguing with well developed characters, but I couldn't relate to any of them except Rachel's roommate who tried to help Rachel get back on her feet and put up with her drinking and lying. Unfortunately, the roommate was the only boring character. The story did move at a steady clip and kept my interest with several surprises.",book
