# Text Mining Final Project

Assignment Description: https://canvas.vu.nl/courses/68136/assignments/247693

All code for the analyses performed for the final project.

There is a separate folder for each analysis:

1. Sentiment analysis - [`sentiment-analysis/`](./sentiment-analysis/)
2. Named Entity Recognition/Classification - [`NERC/`](./NERC/) -- includes two separate notebooks using different techniques:
   1. [`sentiment-nb.ipynb`](./sentiment-analysis/sentiment-nb.ipynb) - Naive Bayes classifiers
   2. [`sentiment-vader.ipynb`](./sentiment-analysis/sentiment-vader.ipynb) - VADER rule-based analysis
3. Topic analysis - [`topic-analysis/`](./topic-analysis/)

Some of the training data was included in the repo (e.g. for [topic analysis](./topic-analysis/topic-datasets/)), but others were too big and are not included.

All of the given test datasets can be found in [`test-datasets/`](./test-datasets/).
